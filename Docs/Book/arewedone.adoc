= Are We Done Yet

This book takes you on a journey starting with very simple Star programs and
ending with a platform that is capable of being deployed on large scale
distributed networks. In the meantime we also explored some quite deep topics in
functional programming, concurrency and developing domain specific languages.

The truth is, of course, that we are only able to scratch the surface
of many of the topics we cover. So, the question is what next?

If you want to go deeper into Star itself then the natural source is the
language definition, which can be obtained at <<Star Reference>>, covers the
language and its standard library.

Finally, dear reader, I would like to thank you for staying the
course. I would like to recommend that you check out Star with
your own programs and please keep us informed of your adventures by
