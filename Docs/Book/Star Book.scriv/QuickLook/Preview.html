<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Why Be a Star Programmer</p>
<p class="itemText">This book is about the programming language called Star. Why, you may ask, do you need to learn yet another language? We hope to answer that question and more in the course of this book. We also aim to show you how to program effectively in Star to solve real world problems.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Programs are huge</p>
<p class="itemText"> If your program is 100 lines long, it does not actually matter what programming language you use to write it in – unless you are learning programming for the first time.</p>
<p class="itemText">However, in practice, software systems are huge. It is normal to develop and to encounter programs measured in 100 Klocs (thousands of lines of code) and it is not uncommon to encounter software systems measured in the millions of lines.</p>
<p class="itemText">Software development at this scale does not share much with developing small systems. Large...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Planning for Change</p>
<p class="itemText">Furthermore, change is the dominant fact of life for large systems. Software systems evolve, grow, are repurposed to meet new objectives, and are re-implemented to take advantage of new technologies.</p>
<p class="itemText">Managing change in code is often left to Source Code Control Systems; but these systems only address part of the problem. For example, code re-use is also a requirement and a challenge for large systems. In fact, one could image the “three R’s” for large systems: reusing, repurposing, and refactorin...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Programming Safely and Effectively</p>
<p class="itemText"> At the same time, safety and security are also critical: no-one likes to have their private information exposed to the bad guys. Most main-stream programming languages were designed in an era when safety was not uppermost in programmers’ minds – usually it was performance. Some seemingly trivial design choices – such as C’s conventions for laying out strings in memory – turn out to have potentially devastating security implications.</p>
<p class="itemText">In addition, systems that are built assuming a shielded execut...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Real-time is normal time</p>
<p class="itemText">Many kinds of business are becoming more and more ‘real-time’: a 100 millisecond slowdown in loading a web page can mean the loss of 5% of revenue for an e-commerce site; an unrented car, like an unrented hotel room, represents a permanent loss of business and a competitive disadvantage.</p>
<p class="itemText">For the modern programmer, this means that applications must be engineered from the start to be responsive and multitasking – aspects that challenge even the most professional of programmers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">This Train is Leaving the Station</p>
<p class="itemText">Perhaps most importantly, we need to be able to do these things now – time to market is a critical factor in many if not most modern applications. Its no good developing the world’s best widget if you run out of ‘runway’ trying to build it.</p>
<p class="itemText">A major bottleneck is the relative poor productivity of most modern programming languages. It is simply too hard to produce correct robust code in languages like C/C++, Python etc.</p>
<p class="itemText">Productivity is an issue for individual programmers but is especially salient ...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">If You Are Already a Java (or C#, or C++) Programmer</p>
<p class="itemText">Most OO languages are embracing some of the simpler features of functional languages. Even Java 8 with its lambda expressions and stream features represents a nod to the power of functional programming.</p>
<p class="itemText">However, at the same time, there is a substantial gap in the capabilities of most OO languages compared to modern functional programming languages. This is a problem because the better a language is able to ‘understand’ your objectives, the better the tools will be able to support those objective...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">If You Are Already a Functional Programmer</p>
<p class="itemText">You have many choices for functional programming languages that are excellent. The author considers two languages that are principal sources of inspiration for many of the functional features of Star: Haskell and Standard ML – both of which are excellent; but not perfect.</p>
<p class="itemText">For the functional programmer, the principal benefits of Star are readability, modernity and predictability.</p>
<p class="itemText">One of the major drivers of the design of Haskell and (to a lesser extent) ML is conciseness. However, conciseness is ...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Technology</p>
<p class="itemText">The technology platform that programs are written for is also changing. Just a few decades ago most computers were single-core; nowadays most computers are multi-core and are capable of significant parallelism.</p>
<p class="itemText">Especially spectacular is the parallelism available in modern GPUs; where a high end graphics processor may have thousands of cores capable of processing instructions in parallel. We expect that the days of personal computers with thousands of cores is not too far in the future.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Design Goals for Star</p>
<p class="itemText">Star is a multi-paradigm high-level symbolic language. It is designed to be scalable, readable, accurate, high performing and extensible.</p>
<p class="itemText">Paradoxically, scalability in a programming language is always about large and small chunks of code. Scalability in Star is fostered by a range of elements that facilitate composition, change and re-use:</p>
<p class="itemText"> • The language is strongly statically typed. This encourages both safety and documentation.</p>
<p class="itemText"> • The type system is strong enough that there is very limited ne...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">About this book</p>
<p class="itemText">This book acts as an introduction to the language and to its use. The basic features of the language are introduced; however, this is not a reference manual: it is not intended to be a complete description of the language.</p>
<p class="itemText">That can be found in the Star Language Definition.</p>
<p class="itemText">Introducing a programming language like Star can be a challenge in presentation. This is because there is a significant amount of mutual support between elements of the language.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Getting hold of Star</p>
<p class="itemText">The easiest way to access the compiler is to pick up the released code from Github.  </p>
<p class="itemText">Assuming that you have downloaded the release files, assuming that you have your Star files in the current directory, you can compile and run a Star program using:</p>
<p class="itemText">$ Star fact.star 10</p>
<p class="itemText">This will compile the file fact.star and run it, passing the integer 10 to the embedded program.</p>
<p class="itemText">The first time you run the compiler it will be a little slow. This is because it also compiles the standard library into the sub-dire...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Typographical Conventions</p>
<p class="itemText">Any text on a programming language often has a significant number of examples of programs and program fragments. We show these using a typewriter-like font, often broken out in a display form:</p>

<p class="itemText">We use the ... ellipsis to explicitly indicate a fragment of a program that may not be syntactically correct as it stands.</p>

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">A Tour of Star</p>
<p class="itemText">Our first task is to introduce you to the Star language. It is difficult to find the right order in which to present a programming language like Star; this is because many of the features are highly inter-related. For example, types depend on values which depend on functions which depend on types!</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">A First Star Program</p>
<p class="itemText">It is traditional to introduce a new programming language with something like the hello world example. Which we will do in a moment. However, the factorial function often makes a better first example for functional programming languages:</p>
<p class="itemText">sample.factorial{</p>
<p class="itemText">  import star.               -- Access standard language features</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">  public fact : (integer)=>integer.</p>
<p class="itemText">  fact(0) => 1.              -- base case</p>
<p class="itemText">  fact(N) where N>0 => N*fact(N-1).</p>

</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Texture</p>
<p class="itemText">All programming languages can be said to have a particular style or texture. This is often so strong that it is often possible to identify a programming language from a single line of source code. In the case of Star, this line might be:</p>
<p class="itemText">public fact : (integer)=>integer.</p>
<p class="itemText">which is a type annotation statement declaring the type of the function fact.</p>
<p class="itemText">The public annotation means that the function is exported by this module and will be available in other modules if the sample.factorial module is impo...</p>
</li>
<hr class="afterText"/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Lexical Style</p>
<p class="itemText">Star’s lexical syntax is a combination of special operators and keywords.</p>
<p class="itemText">It can be difficult for language designers to decide when to use a keyword and when to use a special operator. In the case of Star we use special operators for common elements and keywords when either a graphical operator would be obscure and/or are not common.</p>
<p class="itemText">For example, in the factorial module, we use braces for grouping; but we also use the import and the where keywords. The rationale here is that programmers have bec...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Types</p>
<p class="itemText">Star is a strongly, statically typed language. This means that all variables and expressions have a single type; and that all type constraints are enforceable at compile-time. This is a fairly strong (sic) statement but it is a key aspect of Star’s design – we need everything to be well typed and we also want to guarantee completeness of the type system.</p>
<p class="itemText">The type annotation statement:</p>
<p class="itemText">fact : (integer)=>integer.</p>
<p class="itemText">is a statement that declares that the type of fact is a function of one integer argum...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Rules</p>
<p class="itemText">In Star, most programs are defined using rules. In this case, fact is defined using equations. The equations that make up a function definition (or any program definition for that matter) are statements that are written in order.</p>
<p class="itemText">Rule-based programs support a case driven approach to programming: a program is defined in terms of the different cases or situations that apply. Using rules to cover different cases allows the programmer to focus on each case in relative isolation.</p>
<p class="itemText">In addition, as we s...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Patterns</p>
<p class="itemText">Patterns are ubiquitous in Star: they form the basis of many rules: they are used to define equations, they are used to control action programs, they are used to implement macros.</p>
<p class="itemText">A pattern can be viewed as a combination of a test — does a value match a particular pattern — and as a way ( the way in Star) of binding a variable to a value.</p>
<p class="itemText">An equation’s pattern defines when the equation is applicable. The first equation for fact above:</p>
<p class="itemText">fact(0) => 1.</p>
<p class="itemText">has a literal pattern on the left hand side of ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Packages</p>
<p class="itemText">The normal compilation unit is a package. The sample.factorial package contains just the function fact, but packages can contain functions, type definitions, import statements and many other elements that we will encounter.</p>
<p class="itemText">Package names and references to packages do not refer to file names; package names are symbolic – in general a package name consists of a sequence of identifiers separated by periods.</p>
<p class="itemText">The catalog and repository system explored in Chapter 7 that supports the language ensures a...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Worksheets</p>
<p class="itemText">The other main kind of compilation unit is the worksheet. Worksheets are a modern replacement for the REPL that you see in many functional programming languages.</p>
<p class="itemText">We say a modern replacement for REPLs because worksheets fit much better in the typical environment of an IDE.</p>
<p class="itemText">A worksheet can be used to implement the infamous hello world example in just a few lines:</p>
<p class="itemText">worksheet{</p>
<p class="itemText">  show "hello world".</p>
<p class="itemText">}</p>
<p class="itemText">We can also use a worksheet to display the results of using and testing our fact function:</p>
<p class="itemText">worksheet{...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">String Interpolation</p>
<p class="itemText">The expression</p>
<p class="itemText">"fact(10) is \(fact(10))"</p>
<p class="itemText">is an interpolated string expression. It means the string "fact(10) is \(fact(10))" with the substring \(fact(10)) replaced by the value of the expression embedded within. Interpolated string expressions are a convenient way of constructing string values; and, via the use of contracts, are also type safe.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Types, More Types and Even More Types</p>
<p class="itemText">In many ways, the defining characteristic of a programming language is the approach to types. As we shall see, Star’s type system is quite extensive and powerful; however, simple types are quite straightforward.</p>
<p class="itemText">The most basic question to ask about types is</p>
<p class="itemText">What is a type?</p>
<p class="itemText">There is some surprising variability to the answer to this question; for example, in many OO languages, types are conflated with classes. Star types are terms – i.e., names – that denote different kinds of values.</p>
<p class="itemText">Type</p>
<p class="itemText">A type ...</p>
</li>
<hr class="afterText"/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Nominative Types</p>
<p class="itemText">A nominative type is normally defined using an algebraic type definition. This both introduces a type and defines all the legal values that belong to the type. For example, we might introduce a Person type with the type definition:</p>
<p class="itemText">Person ::= noOne</p>
<p class="itemText">         | someOne{</p>
<p class="itemText">              name : string.</p>
<p class="itemText">              dob : date.</p>
<p class="itemText">            }</p>
<p class="itemText">This statement tells us that there are two kinds of Person: a someOne who has a name and date of birth (dob) associated with them; and a distinguished individual ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Structural Types</p>
<p class="itemText"> A structural type is, informally, a type that looks like a value. For example, the type</p>
<p class="itemText">(integer,string,employee)</p>
<p class="itemText">is a tuple type – it denotes the type of a triple of values, consisting of an integer, a string and an employee in this case.</p>
<p class="itemText">Star has several forms of structural type, the tuple type is one of them; others include record types and function types.</p>
<p class="itemText">We shall see more of these as we introduce the rest of the language. However, it is worth pausing to ask the question Why? Briefly, nomin...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Optional Values </p>
<p class="itemText">Notice that we identified a special case of noOne in our Person type. One reason for including this in a type is to be able to cope with non-existent people. However, this approach is not always the most effective one when modeling situations where a variable or field may not have a value.</p>
<p class="itemText">Explicit null values, as found in Java and similar languages, cause a great number of problems: for example, null must have a special universal type; there are many scenarios where it is not possible for a var...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">The Flavors of Equality </p>
<p class="itemText">Equality in programming languages is typically a very subtle topic. The issues can range from the nature of floating point numbers, the difference between integers and long values and the multiple potential concepts of equality for objects.</p>
<p class="itemText">Equality in Star is always between values of the same type and it is always semantic. So, for example, an equality condition such as:</p>
<p class="itemText">3==3.0</p>
<p class="itemText">is not considered type safe — because 3 is an integer literal and 3.0 is a float literal. If you need to compare an in...</p>

</ul>
<hr class="afterText"/>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">A Tale of Three Loops</p>
<p class="itemText">Imagine that your task is to add up a list of numbers. Sounds simple enough: in most procedural or OO languages (such as Java) one would write a fragment of code that looks like:</p>
<p class="itemText">int total = 0;</p>
<p class="itemText">for(Integer ix:L)</p>
<p class="itemText">  total += ix;</p>
<p class="itemText">However, this code is also full of pitfalls. For one thing we have a lot of extra detail in this code that represents additional commitments beyond those we might be comfortable with:</p>
<p class="itemText"> • we have had to fix on the type of the number being totaled;</p>
<p class="itemText"> • we had to know about Ja...</p>
</li>
<hr class="afterText"/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">A Functional Loop</p>
<p class="itemText">A more idiomatic way of expressing a computation like the totalizer is to use a function. For example, we can write:</p>
<p class="itemText">let{</p>
<p class="itemText">  total(nil) => 0.</p>
<p class="itemText">  total(cons(E,L)) => total(L)+E</p>
<p class="itemText"> } in total(L)</p>
<p class="itemText">while short, this code too has some of the same drawbacks as the for iteration.</p>
<p class="itemText">The type expression cons[integer] refers to the standard type of ‘cons lists’. Similarly, nil refers to the empty list and cons(E,L) refers to the list obtained by prepending E to the list L. We will explore this in more detail in ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">A Totalizer Query</p>
<p class="itemText">While concise, expressions involving much use of leftFold (and the analogous rightFold) can be difficult to follow. An even clearer way of adding up numbers is to use a query expression:</p>
<p class="itemText">fold X with (+) where X in L</p>
<p class="itemText">or the even more succinct</p>
<p class="itemText">total X where X in L</p>
<p class="itemText">This query expression frees us from most of the commitments we endured before: it can add up the elements of any kind of collection — not just cons lists — and it can add up floating point numbers just as easily as integers. Finally, we ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">The Homunculus in the Machine</p>
<p class="itemText">Programming is often taught in terms of constructing sequences of steps that must be followed. What does that imply for the programmer? It means that the programmer has to be able to imagine what it is like to be a computer following instructions.</p>
<p class="itemText">It is like imagining a little person — a homunculus — in the machine that is listening to your instructions and following them literally. You, the programmer, have to imagine yourself in the position of the homunculus if you want to write effective pro...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Contracts and Constraints</p>
<p class="itemText">The concepts of interface and contract are foundational in modern software engineering. This is because explicit interfaces make it substantially easier to develop and evolve systems. A Star contract goes beyond the traditional concept of interface in important ways: we do not mark the definition of a type with its implemented contracts and we allow contracts to involve multiple types.</p>
<p class="itemText">A contract defines a collection of signatures and an implementation provides specific implementations for those...</p>
</li>
<hr class="afterText"/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Implementing Contracts</p>
<p class="itemText"> Defining a contract is a big step, but it is not generally sufficient to produce working programs. If we had a worksheet containing only:</p>
<p class="itemText">worksheet{</p>
<p class="itemText">  contract all t ~~ four[t] ::= {</p>
<p class="itemText">    plus : (t,t)=>t.</p>
<p class="itemText">    sub : (t,t)=>t.</p>

<p class="itemText">  double(X) => plus(X,X).</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">  show double(2)</p>
<p class="itemText">}</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Coercion, not Casting</p>
<p class="itemText">Star does not support automatic type casting, as found in languages like Java and C/C++. This is for many reasons, not the least of which is safety and predictability of code.</p>
<p class="itemText">Casting in many languages is really two kinds of operations-in-one which we can refer to as casting and coercion. Casting is mapping of a value from one type to another without changing the value itself; and coercion involves converting a value from one type to another.</p>

<p class="itemText">It is often easier to introduce functional programming using numerical examples. Last chapter we saw, for example, the factorial program. This is mostly because most programmers are already familiar with numbers. Continuing that tradition, here is a function that returns the sign of a number:</p>
<p class="itemText">sign(X) where X<0 => -1.</p>
<p class="itemText">sign(0) => 0.</p>
<p class="itemText">sign(X) where X>0 => 1.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Patterns</p>
<p class="itemText">A function is defined as a sequence of rewrite equations each of which consist of a pattern and an expression. There are three general forms of rewrite equations:</p>
<p class="itemText">Pattern => Expression</p>
<p class="itemText">or</p>
<p class="itemText">Pattern where Condition => Expression</p>
<p class="itemText">or</p>
<p class="itemText">Pattern default => Expression</p>
<p class="itemText">The left hand side of a rewrite equation consists of the pattern which determines the applicability of the equation; and the right hand side represents the value of the function if the pattern matches.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Order of Evaluation</p>
<p class="itemText">Star is a so-called strict language. What that means is that arguments to functions are evaluated prior to calling the function. Most programming languages are strict; for two main reasons:</p>
<p class="itemText"> 1. It is significantly easier for programmers to predict the evaluation characteristics of a strict language.</p>
<p class="itemText"> 2. It is also easier to implement a strict language efficiently on modern hardware. Suffice it to say that modern hardware was designed for evaluating strict languages, so this argument is somewhat ...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Another Look at Types</p>
<p class="itemText">Organizing data is fundamental to any programming language. Star’s data types are organized around the algebraic data type. In addition, Star’s supports quantified types of several varieties.</p>
</li>
<hr class="afterText"/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Quantified Types</p>
<p class="itemText">A generic type is one which has one or more type variables in it. For example, the type expression:</p>
<p class="itemText">(x,x)=>boolean</p>
<p class="itemText">is such a generic type (assuming that x is a type variable – see below).</p>
<p class="itemText">All type variables must be bound by a quantifier in some enclosing scope. If a type variable is not bound, it is considered free in that type expression.</p>
<p class="itemText">A quantified type is a type that introduces (i.e., binds) a type variable. There are two quantifiers in Star: a universal quantifier and an existential quanti...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Contract Constrained Types</p>
<p class="itemText">We noted above that the type of the standard equality predicate was ‘almost’ the same as:</p>
<p class="itemText">all x ~~ (x,x)=>boolean</p>
<p class="itemText">This type denotes a universally quantified function type that can be applied to arguments of any given type. However, equality in a normal programming language is not universal: not all values admit to being reliably tested for equality. A great example of such a limitation are functions – equality between functions is not well defined.</p>
<p class="itemText">To capture this, we need to be able to constrai...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Algebraic Data Types</p>
<p class="itemText">An algebraic data type definition achieves several things simultaneously: it introduces a new type into scope, it gives an enumeration of the legal values of the new type and it defines both constructors for the values and it defines patterns for decomposing values. This is a lot for a single statement to do!</p>
<p class="itemText">For example, we can define a type that denotes a point in a two-dimensional space:</p>
<p class="itemText">point ::= cart(float,float).</p>
<p class="itemText">This kind of statement is called a type definition statement and is legal in ...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Functions as Values</p>
<p class="itemText">The second principle of functional programming is that functions are first class. What that means is that we can have functions that are bound to variables, passed into functions and returned as the values of functions. In effect, a function is a legal expression in the language. It also means that we can have function types in addition to having types about data.</p>
<p class="itemText">We can see this best by looking at a few examples. One of the benefits of passing functions as arguments to other functions is that i...</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Functions and Closures</p>
<p class="itemText">If a function is an expression, what is the value of the function expression? The conventional name for this value is closure:</p>
<p class="itemText">Closure</p>
<p class="itemText">A closure is a structure that is the value of a function expression and which may be applied to arguments.</p>
<p class="itemText">It is important to note that, as a programmer, you will never ‘see’ a closure in your program. It is an implementation artifact in the same way that the representation of floating point numbers is an implementation artifact that allow computers to represent ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Let Binding Environments</p>
<p class="itemText">We noted that it is difficult to achieve the effect of the (X)=>X==S lambda expression with named functions. The reason is that the lambda is not defined in the same way that named functions are defined — because it occurs as an expression not as a statement. If we wanted to define a named function which also captures S, we would have to be able to define functions inside expressions.</p>
<p class="itemText">There is an expression that allows us to do this: the let expression. A let expression allows us to introduce lo...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Generic Programs</p>
<p class="itemText">If we take a slightly closer look at fTest, we can see that it seems pretty generic: it has a function as argument that it calls in the right places; but otherwise makes few assumptions about the function it calls. However, the type signature of fTest is rather specific:</p>
<p class="itemText">fTest : (sTree,(string)=>boolean)=>boolean</p>
<p class="itemText">which means, for example, that its second argument must be a function from string to boolean. On the other hand, nothing in the actual definition of fTest seems to depend on strings.</p>
</li>
<hr class="afterText"/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Generic Types</p>
<p class="itemText">What actually makes fTest more constrained than it could be is the type definition of sTree itself. It too is unnecessarily restrictive: why not allow trees of any type? We can, using the type definition for tree:</p>
<p class="itemText">all t ~~ tree[t] ::= tEmpty | tNode(tree[t],t,tree[t]).</p>
<p class="itemText">Like the original sTree type definition, this statement introduces a new type: tree[t] which can be read as ‘tree of something’. The name tree is not actually a type identifier — although we often refer to the tree type — but it i...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Generic Functions</p>
<p class="itemText">Given this definition of the tree type, we can construct a more general form of the tree test function; which is almost identical to fTest:</p>
<p class="itemText">test:all t ~~ (tree[t],(t)=>boolean)=>boolean.</p>
<p class="itemText">test(tEmpty,_) => false.</p>
<p class="itemText">test(tNode(L,Lb,R),F) => F(Lb) || test(L,F) || test(R,F).</p>
<p class="itemText">and our original string check function becomes:</p>
<p class="itemText">check(T,S) => test(T,(X) => X==S)</p>
<p class="itemText">The type of check is also more generic:</p>
<p class="itemText">check:all t ~~ (tree[t],t)=>boolean</p>
<p class="itemText">I.e., check can be used to find any type of element in a tree — providin...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr class="afterText"/>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Going Further</p>
<p class="itemText">Although better than the original sTest program there is still one major sense in which the test program is not general enough. We can see this by looking at another example: a function that counts elements in the tree:</p>
<p class="itemText">count:all t ~~ (tree[t]) => integer.</p>
<p class="itemText">count(tEmpty) => 0.</p>
<p class="itemText">count(tNode(L,_,R)) => count(L)+count(R)+1</p>
<p class="itemText">This code is very similar, but not identical, to the test function.</p>
<p class="itemText">The issue is that test is trying to do two things simultaneously: in order to apply its test predicate to a bina...</p>
</li>
<hr class="afterText"/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Going Even Further</p>
<p class="itemText">We have focused so far on generalizing the visitor from the perspective of the tree type. But there is another sense in which we are still architecturally entangled: from the perspective of the check and count functions themselves.</p>
<p class="itemText">In short, they are both tied to our tree type. However, there are many possible collection data types; Star for instance has some 5 or 6 different standard collection types. We would prefer not to have to re-implement the check and count functions for each type.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Polymorphic Arithmetic</p>
<p class="itemText">There are other ways in which programs can be polymorphic. In particular, let us focus for a while on arithmetic. One of the issues in arithmetic functions is that there are many different kinds of numbers. Pretty much every programming language distinguishes several kinds of numbers; for example, Java distinguishes byte, short, int, long, float, double, BigInteger and BigDecimal — and this does not count the wrapped versions. Other languages have even more choice.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">A Word About Type Inference</p>
<p class="itemText">We have seen some powerful forms of types in this chapter: recursive types defined using algebraic type definitions, generic types and even function types. Recall also that Star only requires programmers to explicitly declare the types of quantified variables and functions. It is worth pausing a little to see how this might be done.</p>
<p class="itemText">Recall our original fact function:</p>

<p class="itemText">The straightforward answer to this is no. There is a great deal more to functional programming than can be captured in a few pages. However, we have covered some of the key features of functional programming — particularly as it applies to Star. In subsequent chapters we will take a closer look at collections, at modular programming, at concurrency and even take a pot shot at Monads.</p>

<p class="itemText">Modern programming — whether it is OO programming, functional programming or just plain C programming — relies on a rich standard library. Given that nearly every program needs to be able to manage collections of things, the central pearl of any standard library is the collections library.

<p class="itemTitle">Sequence Notation</p>
<p class="itemText">A sequence is simply an ordered collection; a sequence expression is an expression involving a complete or partial enumeration of the values in the collection. Star has a simple notation for expressing sequences of any underlying type; for example, a cons sequence of integers from 1 through 5 can be written:</p>
<p class="itemText">cons of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</p>
<p class="itemText">In situations where we do not know or do not wish to specify the collection type, we can write instead:</p>
<p class="itemText">[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</p>
<p class="itemText">This term — it could be either an expression o...</p>
</li>
<hr class="afterText"/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Partial Sequence Notation</p>
<p class="itemText">The sequence notation also allows for the specification of partial sequences; this is particularly useful in writing functions that construct and traverse sequences. The sequence term:</p>
<p class="itemText">[1,2,..X]</p>
<p class="itemText">denotes the sequence whose first two elements are 1 and 2 and whose remainder is denoted by the variable X — which must also be a sequence of the correct type. Similarly, the term:</p>
<p class="itemText">[F..,23]</p>
<p class="itemText">denotes the sequence obtained by gluing 23 to the back of the sequence F.</p>
<p class="itemText">There is a strong relationship between th...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">The Sequence Contract</p>
<p class="itemText">Underlying the sequence notation is the sequence contract. This contract contains type signatures that can be used to construct and to match against sequence values. The sequence notation is realized by the compiler translating sequence terms to a series of calls to those functions.</p>
<p class="itemText">The actual sequence contract is</p>
<p class="itemText">contract sequence[t->>e] ::= {</p>

</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Sequence Patterns</p>
<p class="itemText">The complete sequence contract has six signatures in it — the latter three signatures play an analogous role to the first three but for sequence patterns rather than sequence expressions. They also introduce a new form of type expression — the pattern type. For example, the signature for _pair — which is used to decompose sequences into a head and tail — is:</p>
<p class="itemText">_pair:(e,t)<=t.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Notation and Contract-Based Semantics</p>
<p class="itemText">One of the distinctive features of the sequence notation is that it is an example of syntax that is underwritten by a semantics expressed as a contract. This is part of a widespread pattern in Star.</p>
<p class="itemText">This has a parallel in modern OO languages like Java and C# where important contracts are expressed as interfaces rather than concrete types. However, Star extends the concept by permitting special notation as well as abstract interfaces — as many mathematicians understand, a good notation can make a...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Indexing</p>
<p class="itemText">Accessing collections conveniently is arguably more important than a good notation for representing them. There is a long standing traditional notation for accessing arrays:</p>
<p class="itemText">L[ix]</p>
<p class="itemText">where L is some array or other collection and ix is an integer offset into the array. Star uses a notation based on this for accessing collections with random indices; suitably generalized to include dictionaries (collections accessed with non-numeric indices) and slices (contiguous sub-regions of collections).</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">The indexable Contract</p>
<p class="itemText">The indexable contract captures the essence of accessing a collection in a random-access fashion. There are functions in the contract to access a directly accessed element, to replace and to delete elements from the collection:</p>
<p class="itemText">contract all s,k,v ~~ indexable[s->>k,v] ::= {</p>
<p class="itemText">  _index:(s,k)=>option[v].</p>
<p class="itemText">  _set_indexed:(s,k,v)=>s.</p>
<p class="itemText">  _delete_indexed:(s,k)=>s.</p>
<p class="itemText">}</p>

</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Tentative Computation</p>
<p class="itemText">If we look at the signature for _index we can see that this function does not directly return a value from the collection, but instead returns an option value. This bears further explanation.</p>
<p class="itemText">The great unknown of accessing elements of a collection is ‘is it there?’. Its not guaranteed of course, and we need to be able to handle failure.</p>
<p class="itemText">This is where the concept of ‘tentative computation’ becomes important.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Adding and Removing Elements From a Collection</p>

<p class="itemText">Both of these functions have a property often seen in functional programming languages and not often seen elsewhere: they are defined to return a complete new collection rather than simply side-effecting the collection. This is inline with an emphasis on persistent data structures and on declarativ...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">The Index Notation</p>
<p class="itemText">Given the indexable contract we can now show the specific notation that Star has for accessing elements of a collection. Accessing a collection by index follows conventional notation:</p>
<p class="itemText">C[ix]</p>
<p class="itemText">will access the collection C with element identified by ix. For example, given a dictionary D of strings to strings, we can access the entry associated with “alpha” using:</p>

<p class="itemText">We can define an implementation for the indexable contract for this type — if we arrange for the tree to be a tree of key-value pairs:</p>

We cannot (yet) show how to deal with infinite lists of numbers but we can capture the essence of this algorithm using a cascading sequence of filter operations.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Mapping to Make New Collections</p>
<p class="itemText">One of the limitations of the filter function is that it does not create new elements: we can use it to subset collections but we cannot transform them into new ones. The fmap function – part of the functor contract – can be used to perform many transformations of collections.</p>
<p class="itemText">For example, to compute the lengths of strings in a list we can use the expression:</p>

It does, however, offer a guarantee that operations such as element insertion, search and set operations like set union are implemented efficiently.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Packages are Records</p>
<p class="itemText">If we take a slightly deeper look at Star’s package we will see some surprising features; features that are sadly not very common in programming languages.</p>
<p class="itemText">Let’s start with a super simple source package:</p>
<p class="itemText">ss{</p>
<p class="itemText">  public double:(integer)=>integer.</p>
<p class="itemText">  double(X) is X*2.</p>
<p class="itemText">}</p>
<p class="itemText">This package structure is semantically equivalent to a function:</p>
<p class="itemText">ss:{double:(integer)=>integer}.</p>
<p class="itemText">ss = let{</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Existential Types</p>
<p class="itemText">What does it mean to have a type in a record? From a programmer’s point of view it is actually quite a natural extension of the concept of a record; there does not seem to be any intrinsic reason why a record shouldn’t have types in it. However, the logic of this bears a deeper look.</p>
<p class="itemText">The declaration of the foo type involves the use of an existential quantifier:</p>
<p class="itemText">simple:exists foo/1 ~~ {</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Use and Evidence</p>
<p class="itemText">To get a better grip on type quantification in general and existentially quantified types in particular it can be helpful to see what the rules and expectations are for a universally quantified type. Occurrences of a type variable can be classified into two forms — depending on whether the context is one of using a variable or whether one is defining it — or providing evidence for it.</p>
<p class="itemText">Consider the simple function d with its type annotation:</p>
<p class="itemText">d:all t ~~ arith[t] |: (t)=>t.</p>
<p class="itemText">d(X) => X+X.</p>
<p class="itemText">In the equa...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Using Existentially Quantified Types</p>
<p class="itemText">So, what are the rules for existentially quantified types?</p>
<p class="itemText">The first is one that we have already been looking at:</p>
<p class="itemText">An existential variable may be bound to a type when providing evidence that a value has a certain type, but may not be constrained when using a value with an existential quantifier in its type.</p>
<p class="itemText">The second is related to this:</p>
<p class="itemText">Each occurrence of an existentially quantified type is potentially different.</p>
<p class="itemText">Think about a function with the type:</p>
<p class="itemText">exFn:for all t ~~</p>
<p class="itemText">  (t)=>exists e ~~ R[e,t]</p>
<p class="itemText">F...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Wrapping Up Packages</p>
<p class="itemText">Our original simple package record had the type</p>
<p class="itemText">simple: exists f/1 ~~ {</p>
<p class="itemText">  type foo/1.</p>
<p class="itemText">  foo:all t ~~ (t) <=> f[t].</p>
<p class="itemText">  bar:all t ~~ f[t].</p>
<p class="itemText">  fooMe:all t ~~ (t)=>f[t].</p>
<p class="itemText">}</p>
<p class="itemText">The type signature has a type foo and a constructor foo in it. This is permitted because types and values have different name spaces in Star. This is not in fact quite accurate; the precise type of the simple package record should be:</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">simple: exists foo/1 ~~ {</p>
<p class="itemText">  type foo/1.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Opening Up</p>
<p class="itemText">One of the reasons that we are so interested in establishing a ‘normal’ semantics for modules and ADTs is that we can develop systems where the contents of a module depends on some additional computation; i.e., we can use functions over modules. For example, we can show that aspect oriented programming and dependency injection can be realized just using normal code structuring with functions and let environments.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Extensible Types</p>
<p class="itemText">Sometimes, rather than configuring a program with a numeric value (or any other value for that matter), we need to configure it with a type. This does not happen that often, and Star’s type constraints can eliminate many cases where it might be needed; but the requirement still shows up occasionally. Where it can show up is in situations where you need to develop customizable applications — applications that can be extended further by your customers without you having to change a line of your ow...</p>

<p class="itemText">It is important to remember, in thinking about tasks, that there is the extra level of indirection: the value of a task expression is a computation. When the computation is performed, it too has a value.</p>

<p class="itemText">Applying background to a task not only yields a task of the same type, but also one yielding the same value.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Computing with tasks</p>
<p class="itemText">Like other values, tasks are first class: they can be assigned to variables, kept in data structures, passed to and from functions and so forth. This flexibility leads to great expressive power — many patterns of computations can be readily encoded as task-valued functions.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Computation Expressions and the M word</p>

Task expressions are oriented towards the concurrent execution of computations; other forms of computation expression have different purposes. In particular, the simple valof expression:</p>
<p class="itemText">valof{</p>
<p class="itemText">  x = 2;</p>
<p class="itemText">  y = f(x);</p>

<p class="itemText">Tasks support a very simple communication pattern between parts of a computation: a task computes for a while, and then (if appropriate) returns a result to anyone asking for its value — typically a parent task. While a task can spawn sub-tasks, there is no immediate way for tasks to communicate with each other while they are running. Many applications, however, require more fine-grained coordination between tasks.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">A rendezvous is a Future Event</p>
<p class="itemText">A rendezvous is an object describing an event that may or may not happen in the future. The basic operation for a rendezvous is waiting for the event, and when the event happens, it may yield or consume a value.</p>
<p class="itemText">This is reflected in the rendezvous type itself:</p>
<p class="itemText">all t ~~ rendezvous[t]</p>
<p class="itemText">One of the simplest forms of rendezvous denotes a timeout:</p>
<p class="itemText">timeoutRv:(integer) => rendezvous[()].</p>

</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Waiting for Events</p>
<p class="itemText">The wait for operator takes a rendezvous and yields a task that waits for the event described by the rendezvous to happen. So, for example:</p>
<p class="itemText">wait for timeoutRv(2000)</p>
<p class="itemText">is a task that, when performed, does nothing for 2 seconds, and yields the () value.</p>
<p class="itemText">Note that wait for returns a task - it does not execute it. To actually wait for an event, the task must be performed. Typically, within a task block, it is used like so:</p>

<p class="itemText">The focal structure in a triple graph is the triple. This is described as being a triple of a subject/predicate/object. Our triple graph notation is based on the [N3][#N3-W3C] notation — which is a more human readable version of the standard XML RDF syntax adopted by W3C:</p>
<p class="itemText">Subject ! Predicate $ Object.</p>
<p class="itemText">The idea is to make it easy to represent facts like:</p>
<p class="itemText">john ! likes $ mary.</p>
<p class="itemText">peter ! in_department $ accounting.</p>
<p class="itemText">We also allow raw strings in our triples, to enable us to represent information that is...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Design is Iteration</p>
<p class="itemText">As we noted, having a triple graph is only as useful as our ability to use it; especially to examine its contents. To simplify that task we could create a query language specifically for triple graphs. However, a more subtle and integrated approach is to extend the standard built-in query language with conditions that are tailored to work with triple graphs. This has the advantage that we can leverage standard query processing to help process triple graphs.</p>
<p class="itemText">So, we need an extension to standard q...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Operator Precedence Grammar</p>
<p class="itemText">Star has a very flexible syntactic foundation based on Operator Precedence Grammars. You are already quite familiar with operator precedence grammars — they are used in nearly every programming language to represent arithmetic expressions. For example</p>
<p class="itemText">X+Y*3</p>
<p class="itemText">is a very common way of representing the addition of X to the result of multiplying Y by 3. It also represents the application of two operators: + and * which happen to be binary operators.</p>
<p class="itemText">The operator structure of an expression is completel...</p>

<hr class="afterText"/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Mixing Operators</p>
<p class="itemText">The standard N3 notation includes some simple extensions to make certain patterns of facts easier to write. For example, we can write:</p>
<p class="itemText">:Joe ! isa $ :giraffe.</p>
<p class="itemText">:giraffe ! [subclass $ :mammal, has $ :long-neck].</p>
<p class="itemText">:mammal ! [subclass $ :animal, has $ :four-legs].</p>
<p class="itemText">[:giraffe, :mammal, :animal] ! isa $ class.</p>
<p class="itemText">instead of</p>
<p class="itemText">:Joe ! isa $ :giraffe.</p>
<p class="itemText">:giraffe ! isa $ class.</p>
<p class="itemText">:giraffe ! subclass $ :mammal.</p>
<p class="itemText">:giraffe ! has $ :long-neck.</p>
<p class="itemText">:mammal ! isa $ class.</p>
<p class="itemText">:mammal ! subclass $ :animal.</p>
<p class="itemText">:mammal ! has $ :four-legs...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr class="afterText"/>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Embedding Graphs</p>
<p class="itemText">One of Star’s standard syntactic paradigms is the ‘brace term’. We use it to represent records, as in:</p>
<p class="itemText">someone{ name="fred" }</p>
<p class="itemText">We also use it to represent more complex entities like packages and worksheets:</p>
<p class="itemText">worksheet{</p>
<p class="itemText">  show 1+2</p>
<p class="itemText">}</p>
<p class="itemText">Continuing in this tradition we will use a similar syntactic structure to represent complete triple graphs:</p>
<p class="itemText">graph{</p>
<p class="itemText">  [:peter, :john] ! :in_department $ :accounting.</p>
<p class="itemText">  :john ! :address $ "2 smart place".</p>
<p class="itemText">  :john ! :name $ "John Smith".</p>
<p class="itemText">}</p>
<p class="itemText">Since this is a first class value...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr class="afterText"/>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Validation</p>
<p class="itemText">Simply defining operators is not enough to design a language extension. We must be able to make sure that the operators are used sensibly in the appropriate context, and that the Star compiler can make sense of the new syntax. To help with this, Star has a standard way of representing the valid syntactic forms of language extensions — using a set of validation rules.</p>
<p class="itemText">The purpose of a validation rule is two fold: it defines the legal syntactic forms and it enables a language extension designer to...</p>
</li>
<hr class="afterText"/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Escaping our DSL</p>
<p class="itemText">We are making a subtle choice with these validation rules for concept. We are affirming that the only way that we can embed ‘normal’ Star expressions in a concept graph is through variables.</p>
<p class="itemText">In general, it is normally desirable to allow arbitrary expressions to be embedded in DSL extensions. However, one has to design the syntactic mechanism that permits this escape. In our case we take the extremely simple approach of only allowing variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Variations on a Theme</p>
<p class="itemText">Because we want to allow different variations on the legal forms of triple, the complete validation rules for triple are more complex and involve several different categories:</p>
<p class="itemText"> # ?S ! ?V :: triple :- S::nounPhrase :& V::verbPhrase</p>
<p class="itemText"> # ?T :: triple :- error("$T is not a valid triple")</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText"> # ?P $ ?O :: verbPhrase :- P::verb :& O::nounPhrase</p>
<p class="itemText"> # [ ?VP ] :: verbPhrase :- VP::verbPhrases</p>
<p class="itemText"> # ?VP :: verbPhrase :-</p>
<p class="itemText">    error("$VP must have at least one predicate and one object")</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText"> # ?A,?B :: verbPhrases :- A...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr class="afterText"/>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Translating Graphs</p>
<p class="itemText">Once we have rules for validating graph expressions in place the compiler is able to verify the form of triple graph expressions but is not able to type check or compile them. For this we need to be able to translate triple graphs to something the compiler can understand; for that we use macros.</p>
</li>
<hr class="afterText"/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Representing Triple Graphs</p>
<p class="itemText">We start with representing triple graphs. Reflecting the ontology we constructed above, we can define three types to represent concepts, triples, and graphs.</p>
<p class="itemText">There are two kinds of concept, and we want to keep them distinct in our representation:</p>
<p class="itemText">type n3Concept is n3C(string) or n3S(string)</p>
<p class="itemText">The two kinds of concept are the named concept — identified by the n3C constructor — and the literal string — identified by the n3S constructor.</p>
<p class="itemText">The triple is similarly represented by a type definition:</p>
<p class="itemText">type ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Macro Rules[macro-rules]</p>
<p class="itemText">Macros are programs that are executed by the compiler in order to transform terms into simpler forms — with the eventual goal that the terms produced by macro processing are directly understood by the main compiler.</p>
<p class="itemText">There are two kinds of macros in Star: the macro rule and the code macro. A macro rule is a substitution rule that is applied by the Star compiler during normal compilation. For example, the macro rule:</p>
<p class="itemText"> - ?X ==> __uminus(X)</p>
<p class="itemText">is used by the compiler to replace occurrences of unary min...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Meta Language</p>
<p class="itemText">Star has a meta language and a standard type to go with it. This means that expressions in the language may also be values. For example, consider the expression:</p>
<p class="itemText">X+2</p>
<p class="itemText">If the value of X is 3, then the value of this expression is 5. However, we can also examine the language that this expression is made of — by using the quote notation. The expression:</p>
<p class="itemText"><| X+2 |></p>
<p class="itemText">means the name of the expression; for compiler-buffs this is effectively the abstract syntax tree of the expression. Star has a standard ty...</p>
</li>
<hr class="afterText"/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Meta Variables</p>
<p class="itemText">In addition to the basic quote notation for expressions, it also has support for meta-variables. Meta variables are variables embedded in quoted terms — they are variables of the quoted term, not variables in the object language. They are very useful in programs that process quoted expressions — both as expressions and as patterns.</p>
<p class="itemText">For example, to denote a triple pattern one may construct the quoted pattern:</p>
<p class="itemText"><| ?S ! ?P $ ?O |></p>
<p class="itemText">where S, P and O are meta-variables that would be bound to the subjec...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr class="afterText"/>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Code Macros</p>
<p class="itemText">Code macros, as their name suggests, are normal Star functions that are invoked by the compiler on the text that the compiler is compiling. Code macros give the macro programmer almost the full power of Star to implement translation; in particular they can call other functions and use other types than quoted internally. However, code macros are a little more awkward to use than macro rules — there are some special restrictions on their form and what their scope is.</p>
<p class="itemText">Code macros are embedded withi...</p>

</ul>
<hr class="afterText"/>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">After the Translation</p>
<p class="itemText">Translating a DSL into core Star is not always the end of the story. In addition it is important to consider what other ways it should be integrated with the language. For example, we designed a new condition so that triple graphs could participate in queries. In addition, there may be one or more standard contracts that should be implemented for elements of the DSL.</p>
<p class="itemText">Finally, we recall that we fixed on the representation of a triple graph as a list of triples, specifically of n3Triple terms. How...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Is There a Downside to DSLs?</p>
<p class="itemText">Nothing comes without risks, for every yin there is a yang. What, we should ask, are the risk factors in having a programming language that encourages programmers to create DSLs?</p>
<p class="itemText">There are three primary areas that we need to point out:</p>
<p class="itemText"> 1. Programming DSLs is somewhat more difficult than regular programming. This is certainly true: programming with macros requires a certain facility with meta-language. There is much in common between developing compilers and developing macro packages for a DSL. ...</p>

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Chattering Agents</p>
<p class="itemText">Software agents represent one of those concepts that are very compelling – perhaps precisely because it speaks to natural human intuitions. Agents are also a popular model for distributed systems. Distributed systems are often characterized by multiple loci of control – typically one per machine in the system – and assigning an agent to each locus is a very natural architecture.</p>
<p class="itemText">In this chapter we look at how we can build agent-based systems and hence distributed systems.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">A Taxonomy of Agents</p>
<p class="itemText">There is a natural hierarchy of types of agent – which roughly aligns with their roles and capabilities in distributed applications:</p>
<p class="itemText">Agent</p>
<p class="itemText">An agent is an entity that can act; often on behalf of another entity.</p>
<p class="itemText">By extension, a software agent is one that acts primarily in the software domain.</p>
<p class="itemText">The difference between an agent and a function is that the latter must be invoked before any actions in it’s body can be performed; whereas an agent is ‘already’ ready to act.</p>
<p class="itemText">There is a vast potential range ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Speech Actions</p>
<p class="itemText">As the term suggests, speech actions are a communications model based on an anthropomorphic understanding of how agents communicate. Speech actions were first investigated by John Austin[#austin:60] in the 1940’s as a vehicle for understanding the role of speech in human society. Since that time the basic ideas have been progressively formalized by John Searle [#searle:69] and standardized in KQML [#kqml:93] and FIPA [#FIPA].</p>
<p class="itemText">Beyond the anthropomorphism, there are sound technical justifications ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Programming Speech</p>
<p class="itemText">A critical aspect of human communication is the vocabulary employed – more formally the ontology being referenced. The natural analog of this in software systems is the Application Programming Interface (API). An API specifies which functions you may invoke, what their types are and what the expected results of invoking the functions should be.</p>
<p class="itemText">The major semantic difference between an API and an Ontology is that the latter can often convey more semantics. For example, it is possible, in an ontol...</p>
</li>
<hr class="afterText"/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Queries</p>
<p class="itemText">We have, in Star, a better, more systematic, approach to describing and implementing public APIs – based on speech actions. For example, assuming that Ag had the appropriate type similar to that of A above, we could issue a speech action against Ag with a very similar query:</p>
<p class="itemText">query Ag with list of { all y where</p>
<p class="itemText">    (y,"1in-washer") in products and</p>
<p class="itemText">    quantity(y)>20 }</p>

<hr class="afterText"/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Free Variables in Speech</p>
<p class="itemText">Although the body of a query speech action might be any expression, there are some syntactic restrictions on the valid forms of query expression. The primary reason for these restrictions is to make it simpler to determine the scopes of identifiers occurring in the query expression. Specifically, we need to be able to determine for any identifier occurring in the queried expression whether or not it refers to the agent being queried or the outer context.</p>
<p class="itemText">For example, consider the simple query:</p>
<p class="itemText">q...</p>

</ul>
<hr class="afterText"/>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Notifications</p>
<p class="itemText">A notify speech action is intended to communicate the occurrence of an event of some form. In the context of software systems it corresponds to a message being sent on a named channel; however that seems low level in comparison.</p>
<p class="itemText">The form of a notify is a little different to the query:</p>
<p class="itemText">notify Agent with Expression on Channel</p>
<p class="itemText">To notify Ag that there is a new stock item might take the form:</p>
<p class="itemText">notify Ag with</p>

</li>
<hr class="afterText"/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">No Time</p>
<p class="itemText">The notify speech action does not explicitly refer to time, including the time of the event itself. This is because there may be multiple senses in which time must be conveyed: the time of the occurrence, the time of its being noticed, or the time of this speech action.</p>
<p class="itemText">Furthermore, not all applications need time to be explicitly identified. An extreme example of this would be the ticking of a clock. Any listener to a mechanical clock’s ticking would confirm that neither tick nor tock is timesta...</p>

</ul>
<hr class="afterText"/>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Requests</p>
<p class="itemText">Our final form of speech action is the request. A request is intended to denote a request that the recipient perform some action. This is subtly different to the query in that – apart from answering the question – a query should not cause any change of state in the recipient, whereas the request likely would.</p>
<p class="itemText">Even though the difference between query and request may seem subtle to the average programmer the key difference is in the intended use.</p>
<p class="itemText">The form of a request reflects the fact that an act...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">A Missing Performative</p>
<p class="itemText">Star does not have a declare performative – currently. It may be instructive to see why not, especially since we introduced speech action theory with a classic declaration. While it is not likely that a software agent will marry couples any time soon, there are legitimate reasons for wanting the ability to make declarations.</p>
<p class="itemText">A declaration is a speech action whose effect is embedded within the speech action itself. Declarations establish new facts that are shared by the listener and potentially o...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Actors</p>
<p class="itemText">So far we have discussed what talkative agents say to each other but not on how they are built. The simplest structure that responds to this is the actor. Actors are lightweight entities that can respond to speech actions. For example, this actor models some aspects of a bank:</p>
<p class="itemText">agentBank is actor{</p>
<p class="itemText">  private var accts := dictionary of []</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Performance Characteristics of Actors</p>
<p class="itemText">Actors are comparatively efficient at processing speech actions; and they are trusting: that is, they do not perform any validation on the speech actions. One resulting limitation is that they are definitely not safe in a concurrent environment. Again, no interlocking checks are performed – which means that if you use a regular actor in background tasks (say) then you will likely get inconsistent results.</p>
<p class="itemText">Also, actors are somewhat stateful in nature. They are intended to encapsulate the processi...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Concurrent Actors</p>
<p class="itemText">A concurrent actor is similar to a regular light weight actor in that you can communicate with a concurrent actor using speech actions and you can define event rules for the concurrent actor.</p>
<p class="itemText">However, a concurrent actor has an important performance guarantee: only one speech action may be processed concurrently by the actor. This makes it straightforward to ensure that the internal state of a concurrent actor is always consistent in the presence of concurrent access to the actor.</p>

By restricting ourselves to components that only interact via their ports we foster re-usability of components and re-purposability (sic) of code.</p>

<p class="itemText">One of the intentions behind boxes-and-arrows diagrams is to call out the major functional pieces of an application.

We have already seen that a component may have multiple ports but we have not exposed what kind of computation may be going on inside.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Wiring up Boxes and Arrows</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Code Products</p>
<p class="itemText">One important question that must be answered in any scheme that permits importing is “where is the code coming from?”. Star has three architectural elements that are the basis of code management: the code repository, a system of universal resource identifiers (URI) to identify packages uniquely, and _catalog_s to reduce the bureaucratic burden.</p>
<p class="itemText">The issues that show up when managing resources tend to fall in the ‘annoyingly complex’ rather than ‘rocket science’ category. However, that does not ma...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Code Repository</p>
<p class="itemText">Apart from simply being a place compiled code can be kept, a code repository has several other responsibilities: it must be possible to access the compiled code from multiple packages — including packages that were imported. In fact, a Star code repository is able to contain the compiled code of any number of packages — since code repositories are also used to hold compiled libraries as well as applications.</p>
<p class="itemText">In addition, we have to be able to manage multiple versions of a given compiled package;...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Universal Resource Identifier</p>
<p class="itemText">Each package is identified by a URI. The intention of a URI is that a given URI identifies exactly one package.</p>
<p class="itemText">The URI has an IETF standard specification (RFC 2396) [#rfc2396].</p>
<p class="itemText">One important source of confusion with the IETF URI is the distinction between URIs and URLs. Although they share a common syntax a URI is not intended to convey the location of the resource.</p>
<p class="itemText">For example, the URI</p>
<p class="itemText">file://foo/bar/x/y.star</p>
<p class="itemText">looks like a file-based name: one might be tempted to believe that the file x.Star re...</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Transducer</p>
<p class="itemText">The connection between a URI and the actual resource must be established by a transducer. A transducer is any system that can take a URI and produce a copy of identified resource. If you will, the transducer establishes the link between a URI and a URL.</p>
<p class="itemText">The Star compiler has a range of transducers built-in to it; and also has a extensibility mechanism so that you can define your own URI scheme and have it mapped to some physical storage mechanism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Standard URI Schemes</p>
<p class="itemText">Although the Star compiler can, in principle, utilize any URI scheme, some schemes are ‘built-in’ — in the sense that there is a standard transducer for them. It is obviously an implementation dependent aspect of the language: different compilers may support different schemes; but all should support at least the following:</p>
<p class="itemText">star</p>
<p class="itemText">E.g. Star://foo/bar/gar.star. This is intended to be used as a system dependent but universal way of identifying Star files. I.e., each system is free to choose how to fi...</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Catalogs</p>
<p class="itemText">A catalog is a mapping from identifiers to package URIs; i.e., it is the missing link between package identifiers and package URIs. Catalogs are sometimes written explicitly — in the form of a file that you can place in the same directory as your source files — but usually the compiler makes an automatic catalog depending on where the source code of a package is actually located.</p>
<p class="itemText">Like other features, the catalog system is under-pinned by a contract – in this case, the contract is used by the com...</p>
