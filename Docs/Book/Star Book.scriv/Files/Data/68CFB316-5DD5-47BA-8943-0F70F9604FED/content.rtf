\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Programming is often taught in terms of constructing sequences of steps that must be followed. What does that imply for the programmer? It means that the programmer has to be able to imagine what it is like to be a computer following instructions.\
It is like imagining a little person \'97 a homunculus \'97 in the machine that is listening to your instructions and following them literally. You, the programmer, have to imagine yourself in the position of the homunculus if you want to write effective programs in most languages today.\
Not everyone finds such feats of imagination easy. It is certainly often tedious to do so. Using query expressions and other higher-order abstractions significantly reduces the programmer\'92s burden \'97 precisely by being able to take a declarative approach to programming.}
