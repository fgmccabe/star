There are many instances where a programmer needs a collection but does not wish specify any ordering or mapping relationship. The standard set type allows you to construct such entities.\
Using a set type offers the programmer a signal that minimizes assumptions about the structures: the set type is not ordered, and offers no ordering guarantees. It does, however, offer a guarantee that operations such as element insertion, search and set operations like set union are implemented efficiently.\
Like dictionary, the set type is not publicly defined using an algebraic type definition: its implementation is private. It\'92s type is given by the template:\
all t ~~ equality[t] |: set[t]}
