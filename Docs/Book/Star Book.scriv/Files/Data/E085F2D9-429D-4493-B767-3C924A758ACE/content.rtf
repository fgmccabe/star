We are making a subtle choice with these validation rules for concept. We are affirming that the only way that we can embed \'91normal\'92 Star expressions in a concept graph is through variables.\
In general, it is normally desirable to allow arbitrary expressions to be embedded in DSL extensions. However, one has to design the syntactic mechanism that permits this escape. In our case we take the extremely simple approach of only allowing variables.}
