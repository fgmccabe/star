\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 As the term suggests, speech actions are a communications model based on an anthropomorphic understanding of how agents communicate. Speech actions were first investigated by John Austin[#austin:60] in the 1940\'92s as a vehicle for understanding the role of speech in human society. Since that time the basic ideas have been progressively formalized by John Searle [#searle:69] and standardized in KQML [#kqml:93] and FIPA [#FIPA].\
Beyond the anthropomorphism, there are sound technical justifications basing computer communications on speech act theory.\

\b0 \cf2 A speech action is a communication action intended to have an effect on the listener.\
For example, the classic:\
I pronounce you man and wife\
is a speech action. It has an effect; even though no boulders are moved directly as a result of it, it has a substantial impact on the social fabric and therefore can have unbounded consequences in the physical world.\
Informally, a speech action can be considered to be a pair \'96 a 
\i performative
\i0  verb and a 
\i content
\i0  \'96 which in some formalizations takes the form of a 
\i declarative proposition
\i0 . The performative, a communication verb like 
\i inform
\i0 , 
\i command
\i0 , 
\i query
\i0 , or 
\i declare
\i0 , indicates how the content is to be interpreted by a listener. This is highly stylized of course, but it represented a huge advance at the time regarding how communication between intelligent entities (people) should be understood.\
Another aspect of speech actions is that context is very important. It matters that the agent speaking has the authority to make the pronouncement, and that it is done in the right way and in the appropriate situation. Imagine a real judge saying \'91\'91I pronounce you man and wife\'92\'92 in a theatrical play.\
Under normal circumstances, i.e., in the setting where the judge would typically make such a pronouncement, the result of the utterance is a new married couple. However, in this case it would not 
\i count as
\i0  an official action because of the fact it was a line in a play. The person making the declaration is the right person, and has the authority to perform the action but the context is wrong.\
An interesting implication here is that 
\i within the play
\i0  the characters should respond to the matrimonial as though it were real \'96 if the play is to be believable!\
Speech actions are a great basis for expressing the content of communication between software agents \'96 they permit systematization of communication at a far higher level than purely syntactic structures (such as XML and JSON). That higher level enables us to build a common platform that addresses some key questions:\

\cf2 The latter issue relates to the question of 
\i public semantics
\i0 . This is often misunderstood, but can be defined:\

\b0 \cf2 A communication has a public semantics if a third party listening to the communication would understand the communication in the same manner as the sender and receiver of the communication.\
Note that public semantics does 
\i not require
\i0  a third party listening in to every communication; it only requires the adherence to shared standards when communicating speech actions.\
Since we 
\i are
\i0  talking about communication in the context of software, other considerations are also important; in particular, 
\i type safety
\i0 , 
\i crossing machine boundaries
\i0  and 
\i efficiency
