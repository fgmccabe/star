 At the same time, safety and security are also critical: no-one likes to have their private information exposed to the bad guys. Most main-stream programming languages were designed in an era when safety was not uppermost in programmers\'92 minds \'96 usually it was performance. Some seemingly trivial design choices \'96 such as C\'92s conventions for laying out strings in memory \'96 turn out to have potentially devastating security implications.\
In addition, systems that are built assuming a shielded execution environment, behind closed doors as it were, are often actually expected to perform in the full glare of the Internet. Hardening programs so that they stand up to that glare can often dramatically add to the cost of development \'96 both in time and in money.}
