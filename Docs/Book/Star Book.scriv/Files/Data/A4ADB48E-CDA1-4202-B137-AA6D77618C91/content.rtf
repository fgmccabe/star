\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 The standard N3 notation includes some simple extensions to make certain patterns of facts easier to write. For example, we can write:\
:Joe ! isa $ :giraffe.\
:giraffe ! [subclass $ :mammal, has $ :long-neck].\
:mammal ! [subclass $ :animal, has $ :four-legs].\
[:giraffe, :mammal, :animal] ! isa $ class.\
instead of\
:Joe ! isa $ :giraffe.\
:giraffe ! isa $ class.\
:giraffe ! subclass $ :mammal.\
:giraffe ! has $ :long-neck.\
:mammal ! isa $ class.\
:mammal ! subclass $ :animal.\
:mammal ! has $ :four-legs.\
:animal ! isa $ class.\
For the purposes of the operator grammar, literal values like strings, numbers and 
\i bracketed values
\i0  have a priority of 0. However, within a bracketed term \'97 such as\
[:giraffe, :mammal, :animal]\
each element of the list has an expected priority; in case of lists the expected priority is 999. I.e., the maximum priority of any term in a list sequence is 999. If you want to embed an operator expression whose top-level operator is higher than 999 in a list then you need to surround it with parentheses.}
