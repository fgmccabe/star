<p>This book is about the programming language called <strong>Star</strong>. Why, you
may ask, do you need to learn yet another language? We hope to answer
that question and more in the course of this book. We also aim to show
you how to program effectively in <strong>Star</strong> to solve real world
problems.

<p>Many of the world&rsquo;s most popular languages are quite old: C/C++ date
back to the 1970&rsquo;s and 1980&rsquo;s; Java dates back to 1995. Although it
sometimes does not seem like it; quite a lot has changed since those
days.

<h4 class="subsection">1.1.1 Programs are huge</h4>
<p>If your program is 100 lines long, it does not actually matter what
programming language you use to write it in &ndash; unless you are learning
programming for the first time.
</p>
<p>However, in practice, many software systems are huge. It is normal to
develop and to encounter programs measured in 100 Klocs (thousands of
lines of code) and it is not uncommon to encounter software systems
measured in the millions of lines of code.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> To put these numbers into perspective, 500KLocs is comparable to the
expected output of a programmer over their entire career. So, these
systems necessarily involve many people over many years: a team of 10
programmers would take 10 years to write 1M lines of
code.<a name="DOCF1" href="#FOOT1"><sup>1</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Software development at this scale does not share much with developing
small systems. Large scale software is invariably a team effort,
spread over multiple years. It often involves large numbers of
components and multiple sub-systems interacting with each
other. Overall, this is a scenario of staggering heterogeneity and
complexity.
</p>
<p>If there is one theme that is common in large code bases is that
tooling is critical: powerful IDEs can make a difference in
productivity measured in factors of 2-5. However, it is our opinion
that language tooling starts with a sound programming language design:
the sounder the foundations, the taller the structure that can be
built on it.

<a name="Planning-for-change-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">1.1.2 Planning for change</h4>
<p>Furthermore, <em>change</em> is the dominant fact of life for large
systems. Software systems evolve, grow, are repurposed to meet new
objectives, and are re-implemented to take advantage of new
technologies.
</p>
<p>Managing change in code is often left to Source Code Control Systems;
but these systems only address part of the problem. For example,
<em>code re-use</em> is also a requirement and a challenge for large
systems. In fact, one could imagine a <em>three
Rs</em><a name="DOCF2" href="#FOOT2"><sup>2</sup></a>  for software engineering: Reuse, Repurpose, and
Refactor.
</p>
<p>When the code base is over 500 Kloc, the theoretical probability of
being able to re-use existing code is high, the actual probability of
re-use may be very low &ndash; software engineers may simply not be able to
find the needle in the code haystack, or, typically, the cost of
re-using code may outweigh the cost of developing from scratch.
</p>
<p>The need to repurpose reflects the fact that requirements change and
that software written for one purpose may be used for something
different. Finally, even if the requirements dont change, the context
almost certainly will: increasing workload can lead to a need to
refactor existing code to enable it to meet changing needs.
</p>
<p>There is another kind of change that we need to consider: the
evolution of our programming languages and other tools. A successful
programming language is part of an ecosystem. That ecosystem consists
of the language itself, together with compilers and related tools. It
also contains libraries, frameworks and packages. In many cases the
libraries that are associated with a language are far more important
than the language compiler (e.g., Java&rsquo;s package ecosystem is
enormous).
</p>
<p>A well designed language is capable of supporting a large variety of
libraries without running into limitations. Furthermore, a well
designed language is structured in a way that supports its own
evolution &ndash; new requirements can lead to new features being added to
the language.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Managing this evolution may be the hardest aspect of designing
programming languages!

<h4 class="subsection">1.1.3 Programming safely and effectively</h4>

<p>At the same time, safety and security are also critical: no-one likes
to have their private information exposed to the bad guys. Most
main-stream programming languages were designed in an era when safety
was not uppermost in programmers&rsquo; minds &ndash; usually it was
performance. Some seemingly trivial design choices &ndash; such as C&rsquo;s
conventions for laying out strings in memory &ndash; turn out to have
potentially devastating security implications.
</p>
<p>In addition, systems that are built assuming a shielded execution
environment, behind closed doors as it were, are often actually
expected to perform in the full glare of the Internet. Hardening
programs so that they stand up to that glare can often dramatically
add to the cost of development &ndash; both in time and in money.

<p>Many kinds of business are becoming more and more &lsquo;real-time&rsquo;: a small
&ndash; over the order of milliseconds &ndash; slowdown in loading a web page
can mean the loss of 5% or more of revenue for an e-commerce site; an
unrented car, like an unrented hotel room, represents a permanent loss
of business and a competitive disadvantage.
</p>
<p>For the modern programmer, this means that applications must be
engineered from the start to be responsive and multitasking &ndash; aspects
that challenge even the most professional of programmers.

<p>Perhaps most importantly, we need to be able to do these things
<em>now</em> &ndash; time to market is a critical factor in many if not most
modern applications. Its no good developing the world&rsquo;s best widget if
you run out of &lsquo;runway&rsquo; trying to build it.
</p>
<p>A major bottleneck is the relative poor productivity of most modern
programming languages. It is simply too hard to produce correct robust
code in languages like C/C++, Python etc.
</p>
<p>Productivity is an issue for individual programmers but is especially
salient for programmer teams.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every successful software project involves a team.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The requirements for team-based development tend to put certain
aspects of programming language design into sharp focus. For example,
strong types and clear interfaces may be excellent aids for individual
programmers but they are absolutely paramount for team development.
</p>
<p>More generally, in a competitive environment, the only way to reliably
out-perform the competition in reaching the market is to use radically
more productive technology.

<p>The technology platform that programs are written for is also
changing. Just a few decades ago most computers were single-core;
nowadays most computers are multi-core and are capable of significant
parallelism.
</p>
<p>Especially spectacular is the parallelism available in modern GPUs;
where a high end graphics processor may have thousands of cores
capable of processing instructions in parallel. We expect that the
days of personal computers with thousands of cores is not too far in
the future.
</p>
<p>Programming parallel machines with conventional languages is an
exercise in frustration. This is because programming models that
worked in single core computers do not scale well to highly parallel
machines. One of the primary reasons for this is that state &ndash; as
represented by the changing values of variables &ndash; is <em>implicit</em>
in procedural and object oriented languages. The implicitness of state
is important because it makes many programs easier to express. On the
other hand, that implicitness becomes a liability in multi-threaded
and parallel situations where state is no longer so well behaved.
</p>
<p>However, <strong>Star</strong> has adopted some of the recent innovations in that
make dealing with multi-tasking and parallel execution easier. These
innovations layer on top of basic features such as threading and
provide simpler models of execution than &lsquo;conventional&rsquo; threaded
models. <strong>Star</strong>&rsquo;s computation expressions combine the best of
fork-join queues and map-reduce frameworks whilst enabling a more
normal style of programming.

<h4 class="subsection">1.2.1 If you are already a Java (or C#)</h4>

<p>Most OO languages are embracing some of the simpler features of
functional languages. Even modern Java with its lambda expressions and
stream features represents a nod to the power of functional
programming. However, at the same time, there is a substantial gap in
the capabilities of most OO languages compared to modern functional
programming languages.
</p>
<p>Fundamentally, OO languages revolve around <em>nouns</em> rather than
<em>verbs</em>. Verbs (methods) are relegated to being inside the scope
of some noun (object): they are not first class.  In functional
programming languages, like <strong>Star</strong>, there is more of an balance
between nouns and verbs.
</p>
<p>It is possible to have functions that are about data; it is also quite
straightforward in functional programming languages to have data
structures with functions embedded in them. In fact, a simple
definition of a <em>module</em> is a record that contains functions in
it.
</p>
<p>While OO languages like Java provide excellent <em>data abstraction</em>
tools, the same cannot be said for <em>control abstractions</em>. The
result is that OO languages are &lsquo;stuck in the 1970s&rsquo; when it comes to
control abstractions. However, concepts such as map/reduce,
computation expressions, and continuations bring a rich suite of new
control possibilities that solve important problems in modern
programming.
</p>
<p>Similarly, the type systems of languages like Java (or C# or C/C++)
make are not as expressive or sensitive as modern type systems in
functional languages can be. Professional programmers will recognize a
typical symptom of insufficiently expressive types: lots of casting
and dynamic meta-programming. But, while powerful, these techniques
amount to giving up on types and their important
advantages. Furthermore, contrary to many programmers&rsquo; expectations, a
modern type system is quite capable of dealing statically with
scenarios that require dynamic programming in languages like Java.

<h4 class="subsection">1.2.2 If you are already a C++ programmer</h4>

<p>Moving to a language like <strong>Star</strong> is a radically different programming
experience for the C++ programmer. However, most of the differences
are not because <strong>Star</strong> is a functional programming language. Rather,
it is because <strong>Star</strong> does not abide by two of C++&rsquo;s core principles:
zero-cost abstractions and compatibility with C.
</p>
<p>While <strong>Star</strong>&rsquo;s compiler does not willfully make programs execute more
slowly, strict CPU performance is not the primary driver for design
features. This shows up in a desire to avoid the so-called premature
optimization problem: of optimizing the wrong feature.
</p>
<p>In the case of <strong>Star</strong> vs C++, the most salient of these is likely to
be the different ways that generic programs are compiled: C++ compiles
generic programs by constructing special case implementations for all
used versions of the generic program; whereas <strong>Star</strong> constructs a
single &ndash; type agnostic &ndash; implementation of generic functions.
</p>
<p>This affects many aspects of one&rsquo;s day-to-day usage of the language
and its tooling. One of which is that, for a compiler that has been in
daily use for over 40 years, C++ compilers are still remarkably
slow. C++ binaries can often be very large &ndash; typically outclassed in
performance by the Java compiler.
</p>
<p>The compatibility with C requirement has meant that C++ has to support
many programming paradigms (such as pointer arithmetic) that most
modern programming languages &ndash; <strong>Star</strong> included &ndash; eschew.
</p>
<p>Pointer arithmetic is known to put applications at risk of severe
security problems; and there are many modern safer alternatives (which
C++ does also support).
</p>
<p>Beyond these, you will find <strong>Star</strong> to be a rich and expressive
language; especilly if your focus is on applications rather than
systems programming.

<h4 class="subsection">1.2.3 If you are already a functional programmer</h4>

<p>You have many choices for functional programming languages that are
excellent. The author considers two languages that are principal
sources of inspiration for many of the functional features of <strong>Star</strong>:
Haskell and Standard ML (SML) &ndash; both of which are excellent; but not
perfect.
</p>
<p>For the functional programmer, the principal benefits of <strong>Star</strong> are
<em>readability</em>, <em>modernity</em> and <em>predictability</em>.
</p>
<p>One of the major drivers of the design of Haskell and (to a lesser
extent) SML is conciseness. However, conciseness is not the same as
readability. In modern software development environments there are
many stakeholders beyond the developer. Having a language that is easy
to follow by non-technical readers is a major benefit in mixed skill
teams.
</p>
<p>Like Haskell, <strong>Star</strong> has a powerful type system. <strong>Star</strong>&rsquo;s type
system has many features in common with Haskell&rsquo;s type system &ndash;
features that typically go beyond the capabilities of many OO
languages. In particular, <strong>Star</strong>&rsquo;s contract system is reminiscent of
Haskell&rsquo;s type classes; and <strong>Star</strong>&rsquo;s existential and higher-kinded
types give considerable expressive power to the programmer.
</p>
<p><strong>Star</strong> does not follow all of Haskell&rsquo;s type features; and some type
concepts are rephrased into terminology that is more familiar to
main-stream (sic) programmers.
</p>
<p>Like SML, <strong>Star</strong> has a powerful module system. However, unlike SML&rsquo;s
functors, <strong>Star</strong> modules are first class values. This means that
there is no artificial separation between &lsquo;ordinary&rsquo; programs and
&lsquo;functor&rsquo; programs.
</p>
<p>The result is a balanced set of type features that provides
capabilities that scale well from small programs to large systems.
</p>
<p><strong>Star</strong>&rsquo;s evaluation is, like that of SML but unlike Haskell,
strict. We believe that that makes it significantly easier to reason
about the actual behavior and performance of programs. However,
<strong>Star</strong> has a rich set of features that support productive concurrent
and parallel programming &ndash; based on a combination of system threads
and the features of Concurrent ML.
</p>
<p>Like SML, <strong>Star</strong> is not a strictly &lsquo;pure&rsquo; language. This was neither
an accident nor an afterthought. Computer systems are built to fulfill
purposeful activity (although there may be many times when the actual
purpose is hard to discern). For example, if I deposit a check into my
bank account, I require that the bank&rsquo;s state is updated to reflect my
new balance: the world has changed as a result of my action.
</p>
<p>However, the converse does not follow: just because the world is
stateful does not mean that all our programs should be needlessly
stateful. Much, if not most, of a given application program can and
should be crafted in a mathematical style &ndash; the merits of functional
programming are very great.
</p>
<p>Overall, the primary rationale in the design of <strong>Star</strong> is to empower
the programmer in making obviously correct programs.

<h3 class="section">1.3 Design goals for Star</h3>

<p><strong>Star</strong> is a multi-paradigm high-level <em>symbolic</em> language. It is
designed to be scalable, readable, accurate, high performing and
extensible.
</p>
<p>Paradoxically, scalability in a programming language is always about
large and small chunks of code. Scalability in <strong>Star</strong> is fostered by
a range of elements that facilitate composition, change and re-use:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The language is strongly statically typed. This encourages both safety
and documentation.  The type system is strong enough that there is
very limited need to escape the type system. For example, modules can
be given a first-class type semantics. This is important because it
facilitates programmatic manipulation of modules in a safe manner.

</li><li> Programs are defined in terms of rules; for example, functions are
defined in terms of equations. Apart from being more readable, rules
are also a natural unit of change in an evolving system.

<p>A meta-language based on logical annotations makes it possible to
build meaningfully connected documentation and facilitates processes
such as code re-use, issue tracking, and code lifetime management.
</p></li><li> The package system is intrinsically versioned and abstracted away from
any underlying storage system.
</li></ul>

<p>The syntax of <strong>Star</strong> is oriented towards readability rather than
strict conciseness. The reason for this is that the programmer is only
one of the stake holders in a given program. A readable program is one
that is more easily trusted by non-programmers.
</p>
<p>Experience also suggests that readability enhances programmer
productivity also: much of team-based development involves
comprehending and modifying other programmers&rsquo; code.
</p>
<p><strong>Star</strong> is a strongly, statically typed language. The purpose of a
strong type system is to facilitate the communication of intent of the
programmer. The purpose of static typing is to ensure that the
compiler can rapidly &lsquo;fail&rsquo; incorrect programs without requiring the
program to be run. Furthermore, static type checking minimizes any
run-time penalty for imposing type constraints.
</p>
<p>Although <strong>Star</strong> is strongly typed, it uses <em>type inference</em> to
eliminate much of the clutter that some type systems impose on the
programmer &ndash; which itself is a productivity sink of course.
</p>
<p>Generally, the <em>stronger</em> the type system, the more the language
system can detect errors before programs are run. In addition, the
more <em>expressive</em> the type system is, the less the temptation to
try to subvert or bypass the type system.
</p>
<p>However, even though it is technically feasible to completely
eliminate type declarations of functions; doing so is in conflict with
some of the other goals behind <strong>Star</strong>. For example, type declarations
act as a form of documentation; and when there is a type error in your
program, having <em>no</em> explicit type declarations can make tracking
the culprit of the error very difficult. So all top-level variable
definitions (typically functions) are required in <strong>Star</strong> to have
explicit type <em>annotations</em>.<a name="DOCF3" href="#FOOT3"><sup>3</sup></a>
</p>
<p><strong>Star</strong> has a range of features that make exploiting parallelism
easier to manage. For example, it has support for <em>computation
expressions</em> and <em>actors</em>. Partitioning an application into
different <em>agents</em> allows programming to follow a more human
approach. Computation expressions allow the programmer to manipulate
computations as easily as they do data values; that in turns greatly
eases the development of parallel and concurrent applications.
</p>
<p>There is no one technology that can solve all problems. This is as
true for programming as for other domains. <strong>Star</strong> supports a range of
programming paradigms that allows the developer to &lsquo;use the best tool
for the job&rsquo;. However, we go beyond this &lsquo;swiss army knife&rsquo; stance and
make it straightforward to extend the language.
</p>
<p>Virtually every non-trivial program can be factored into a combination
of general purpose mechanism and specific policy for applying the
mechanism. <strong>Star</strong> has powerful self-extension features that allow
programmers to design their own policy structures (a.k.a. domain
specific languages).
</p>
<p>Many of <strong>Star</strong>&rsquo;s own features &ndash; such as its query notation and its
actor notation &ndash; are built using these extension mechanisms.

<p>This book acts as an introduction to the language and to its use. The
basic features of the language are introduced; however, this is not a
reference manual: it is not intended to be a complete description of
the language.
</p>
<p>That can be found in the <strong>Star</strong> Language Definition.
</p>
<p>Introducing a programming language like <strong>Star</strong> can be a challenge in
presentation. This is because there is a significant amount of mutual
support between elements of the language.
</p>
<p>Our strategy is to take a layered approach &ndash; we start with simple
examples, occasionally skipping over certain aspects of the language
without explanation. Later chapters focus on deeper, more complex
topics.
</p>
<p>For the most part, examples in the text of the book are
executable. You are encouraged to try to get them running on your own
system.

<p>Our first task is to introduce you to the <strong>Star</strong> language. It is
difficult to find the right order in which to present a programming
language like <strong>Star</strong>; this is because many of the features are highly
inter-related. For example, types depend on values which depend on
functions which depend on types!
</p>
<p>Instead, our approach in this book is to take a series of horizontal
slices through the whole language; going progressively deeper as you
become more comfortable with the language. Each layer represents a
reasonably workable subset of the complete language.
</p>
<p>Since a layered approach means that any given description may be
incomplete or slightly inaccurate, there is a temptation to use
footnote annotations which declare &rsquo;&hellip; but there is

<h3 class="section">2.1 A first Star program</h3>

<p>It is traditional to introduce a new programming language with
something like the hello world example. Which we will do in a
moment. However, the factorial function often makes a better first
example for functional programming languages:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">sample.factorial{
  import star.               -- Access standard language features

  public fact : (integer)=&gt;integer.
  fact(0) =&gt; 1.              -- base case
  fact(N) where N&gt;0 =&gt; N*fact(N-1).
}
</pre></div>

<p>This is not an executable program per se.; however, it does represent
a more typical source code unit &ndash; most programs are built from many
smaller modules which come together to make the application. This
program is small, but already introduces many of the key elements of
the <strong>Star</strong> language.
</p>
<p>In this module, we see the name of the module &ndash;
<code>sample.factorial</code> &ndash; an import statement and a function
definition &ndash; of the <code>fact</code> function.
</p>
<p>Source code can be in any form of textual container. There is, for
example, no specific requirement that this <code>sample.factorial</code>
package be in a file called <code>factorial.star</code>; although that may
be good advice. Instead, the <strong>Star</strong> system relies on a <em>catalog
based</em> system that maps package names to text entities. The catalog
system also serves as an anchor point in the version management of
<strong>Star</strong> programs. We will cover this, and the related repository
system for generated artifacts, in Chapter 4.

<h3 class="section">2.2 Texture</h3>

<p>All programming languages can be said to have a particular
<em>style</em> or <em>texture</em>. This is often so strong that it is
often possible to identify a programming language from a single line
of source code. In the case of <strong>Star</strong>, this line might be:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">public fact : (integer)=&gt;integer.
</pre></div>
<p>which is a <em>type annotation statement</em> declaring the type of the
function <code>fact</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>public</code> annotation means that the function is exported by
this module and will be available in other modules where the
<code>sample.factorial</code> module is imported.

</div>
<a name="Lexical-style-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">2.2.1 Lexical style</h4>

<p><strong>Star</strong>âs lexical syntax uses a combination of special operators and
keywords.
</p>
<p>It can be difficult for language designers to decide when to use a
keyword and when to use a special operator. In the case of <strong>Star</strong> we
use special operators for common elements and keywords when either a
graphical operator would be obscure and/or is not common.
</p>
<p>For example, in the factorial module, we use braces for grouping; but
we also use the <code>import</code> and the <code>where</code> keywords. The
rationale here is that programmers have become used to seeing braces
for grouping statements;<a name="DOCF5" href="#FOOT5"><sup>5</sup></a>
whereas the import and where elements are somewhat rarer.
</p>
<p>Notice that every statement is terminated with a period. This is one
of those places where a little redundancy can help when building large
programs: the statement terminator is not technically necessary; but
it helps to reduce the scope of error messages.<a name="DOCF6" href="#FOOT6"><sup>6</sup></a>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> The precise rule is slightly more nuanced: a period is required to
terminate a statement; unless the last character of the statement is a
closing brace &ndash; or unless the statement is itself the last statement
in a brace sequence.<a name="DOCF7" href="#FOOT7"><sup>7</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Another aspect of <strong>Star</strong>âs texture that may not be visible at this
stage is the reliance on an underlying meta-grammar &ndash; specifically on
an <em>operator precedence grammar</em>. OPGs are likely already
familiar to you: it is the almost universally used grammar that
underpins arithmetic expressions. We take the OPG and stretch its use
to include the whole language. The relevance of this will be apparrent
when we look at <em>extending</em> <strong>Star</strong> with new language features.

<a name="Types-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">2.2.2 Types</h4>
<p><strong>Star</strong> is a strongly, statically typed language. This means that all
variables and expressions have a single type; and that all type
constraints are enforceable at compile-time. This is a fairly strong
(sic) statement but it is a key aspect of <strong>Star</strong>âs design &ndash; we need
everything to be well typed and we also want to guarantee completeness
of the type system.
</p>
<p>The type annotation statement:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">fact : (integer)=&gt;integer.
</pre></div>

<p>is a statement that declares that the type of <code>fact</code> is a
function of one integer argument and which returns an integer result.
</p>
<p><strong>Star</strong> encourages, but does not require, most programs to have
explicit type annotations. The precise rule is a little subtle:
variables whose type are not quantified <em>may</em> have their type
automatically inferred. For top-level functions, that annotation is
often contiguous in the text; but in other cases that may not be the
case.
</p>
<p>Other variables &ndash; like the variable <code>N</code> which is part of the
second recursive equation &ndash; do not need type annotations. This is
possible because underlying the type system is a powerful <em>type
inference</em> system that can actually infer all types.
</p>
<p>The result is that a lot of the &lsquo;clutter&rsquo; that can pervade a strongly
typed language is just not necessary; but the use of explicit type
annotations for top-level definitions provides useful structure and
documentation.
</p>
<p>Note that the requirement is that quantified <em>definitions</em> have
explicit type annotations. We donât distinguish functions in any way
here. In particular, functions which are <em>not</em> generic &ndash; for
example lambda functions &ndash; do not need type annotations.

<h4 class="subsection">2.2.3 Rules</h4>

<p>In <strong>Star</strong>, most programs are defined using <em>rules</em>. In this
case, <code>fact</code> is defined using <em>equations</em>. The equations
that make up a function definition (or any program definition for that
matter) are statements that are written in order.
</p>
<p>Rule-based programs support a <em>case driven</em> approach to
programming: a program is defined in terms of the different cases or
situations that apply. Using rules to cover different cases allows the
programmer to focus on each case in relative isolation.
</p>
<p>In addition, as we shall see later on, the partitioning of programs
into cases like this is very helpful in supporting large-scale issues
such as code annotations, versioning and life-cycle management.
</p>
<p><strong>Star</strong> has various kinds of rules, including function definitions,
grammar definitions, variable definitions and type definitions.

<a name="Patterns-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">2.2.4 Patterns</h4>
<p>Patterns are ubiquitous in <strong>Star</strong>: they form the basis of many rules:
including, most importantly, to define equations. In fact, <em>all</em>
variables are introduced by means of patterns.
</p>
<p>A pattern can be viewed as a combination of a test &mdash; does a value
match a particular pattern &mdash; and as a way ( <em>the</em> way in
<strong>Star</strong>) of binding a variable to a value.
</p>
<p>An equationâs pattern defines when the equation is applicable. The
first equation for <code>fact</code> above:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">fact(0) =&gt; 1.
</pre></div>
<p>has a literal pattern on the left hand side of the <code>=&gt;</code>
operator. This equation only applies when <code>fact</code> is called with
zero as its argument.
</p>
<p>The pattern in the second equation:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">fact(N) where N&gt;0 =&gt; N*fact(N-1).
</pre></div>

<p>has a guard on it &mdash; after the <code>where</code> keyword. Guards are
additional conditions that constrain patterns. In this case, the
equation only applies if the argument is greater than zero.
</p>
<p>Any pattern may be qualified with a guard; we could have written the
guard <em>inside</em> the argument pattern:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">fact(N where N&gt;0) =&gt; N*fact(N-1).
</pre></div>

<p>We did not because having the guard outside the arguments is neater.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> The fact functionâs equations are not fully covering: there are no cases for fact for negative numbers. This means that the function is <em>partial</em>; and if called with a negative number will result in a run-time exception.

<h4 class="subsection">2.2.6 Worksheets</h4>

<p>The other main kind of compilation unit is the
<em>worksheet</em>. Worksheets are a modern replacement for the
REPL<a name="DOCF8" href="#FOOT8"><sup>8</sup></a> that you see in many functional
programming languages.
</p>
<p>We say a <em>modern</em> replacement for REPLs because worksheets fit
much better in the typical environment of an IDE.
</p>
<p>A worksheet can be used to implement the infamous hello world example
in just a few lines:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">worksheet{
  show &quot;hello world&quot;.
}
</pre></div>

<p>We can also use a worksheet to display the results of using and
testing our fact function:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">worksheet{
  import sample.factorial.
  show &quot;fact(10) is \(fact(10))&quot;.
  assert fact(5) == 120.
}
</pre></div>

<p>Worksheets are like a combination of a module and the transcript of a
session. In an IDE, the ideal mode of displaying a worksheet is via an
interactive editor that responds to edit changes by recomputing the
transcript and displaying the results in-line.
</p>
<p>The key features of a worksheet that we will use are the ability to
import packages, define elements, show the results of computations and
define assertions.

string expressions are a convenient way of constructing string values;

<h3 class="section">2.3 Types, more types and even more types</h3>

<p>In many ways, the defining characteristic of a programming language is
the approach to types. As we shall see, <strong>Star</strong>âs type system is quite
extensive and powerful; however, simple types are quite
straightforward.
</p>
<p>The most basic question to ask about types is
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is a type?
</p></blockquote>

<p>There is some surprising variability to the answer to this question;
for example, in many OO languages, types are conflated with
classes. <strong>Star</strong> types are terms &ndash; i.e., names &ndash; that denote
different kinds of values.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Type:</b> A type is a term that denotes a collection of values.<a name="DOCF9" href="#FOOT9"><sup>9</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Star</strong>âs type system can be broken down into a number of dimensions:
</p>
<ul>
<li> How legal values of various kinds can be identified with a type;
</li><li> the treatment of type variables and quantifiers; and
</li><li> constraints on types, particularly type variables
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Star</strong> distinguishes two basic styles of type: so-called
<em>structural</em> or transparent types and <em>nominative</em> or opaque
types. A structural type term echoes the values it models, whereas a
nominative type typically does not.
</p>
<p>For example, the standard type <code>integer</code> is nominative &mdash; its
name gives no hint as to the representation, structure or kinds of
values that are modeled by integer.<a name="DOCF10" href="#FOOT10"><sup>10</sup></a> However, a nominative type often indicates some
actual entity being modeled &ndash; in this case integer values. Two
nominative types which have different names always denote distinct
values, whereas two structural types that look the same are actually
identical.

</div>
<a name="Nominative-types-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">2.3.1 Nominative types</h4>

<p>A nominative type is normally defined using an <em>algebraic type
definition</em>. This both introduces a type and defines all the legal
values that belong to the type. For example, we might introduce a
Person type with the type definition:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">Person ::= noOne
         | someOne{
             name : string.
             dob : date.
           }
</pre></div>

<p>This statement tells us that there are two kinds of <code>Person</code>: a
<code>someOne</code> who has a <code>name</code> and date of birth (<code>dob</code>)
associated with them; and a distinguished individual we identify as
<code>noOne</code>. The no-one individual <em>does not</em> have a name or
date of birth.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notice how the type annotation statement we saw for declaring the type
of <code>fact</code> is also used for defining the types of fields in the
<code>someOne</code> record.
</p></blockquote>

<p>We can <em>make</em> a Person value with a labeled record expression:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">S = someOne{
  name = &quot;fred&quot;.
  dob = today()
}
</pre></div>

<p>The equality symbol is used to introduce a new single-assignment
variable. In this case the variable <code>S</code> is defined to be a
<code>someOne</code> record.
</p>
<p>Recall that names do not always require an explicit type
annotation. In this case we can infer that <code>S</code> is a <code>Person</code>
(because <code>someOne</code> marks it). Furthermore, we do not need to
explicitly give types to the <code>name</code> and <code>dob</code> fields because
their type is constrained by the type declaration for <code>Person</code>.

<a name="Reference-Type-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">2.3.2 Reference Type</h4>

<p>An important detail about the <code>someOne</code> record defined above is
that the fields within it are not re-assignable. If we want to make a
variable reassignable, or if we want to make a field of a record
reassignable, we use a special <code>ref</code> type to denote that. For
example, the type definition
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">employee ::= employee{
  dept : ref string.
  name : string
}
</pre></div>

<p>allows the <code>dept</code> field within the employee record to be
modifiable &ndash; although the employee&rsquo;s name is still fixed.
</p>
<p>Only fields that have a <code>ref</code> type are modifiable in
records. This is even true when a record is assigned to a reassignable
variable.
</p>
<p>A reassignable variable is declared using the <code>:=</code> operator:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">N := employee{
  dept := &quot;your department&quot;.
  name = &quot;Anon. Y. Mouse&quot;
}
</pre></div>

<p>Since the variable <code>N</code> is declared as being reassignable, we can
give it a new value:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">N := employee{
  dept := &quot;another&quot;.
  name = &quot;some one&quot;
}
</pre></div>

<p>We can also modify the <code>dept</code> field of <code>N</code>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">N.dept := &quot;new department&quot;.
</pre></div>
<p>However, we cannot modify the <code>name</code> field &ndash; because it is not
re-assignable within the <code>Person</code> type.
</p>
<p>Notice that the re-assignability of variables and fields does not
inherit: each field or variable is separate. So, for example, if we
declared a single-assignment variable <code>D</code> to be an employee:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">D = employee{
  dept := &quot;his department&quot;.
  name = &quot;Your Name Here&quot;
}
</pre></div>

<p>then, even though <code>D</code> itself cannot be re-assigned to, the
<code>dept</code> field of <code>D</code> <em>can</em> be altered:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">D.dept := &quot;my department&quot;
</pre></div>

<h4 class="subsection">2.3.3 Structural types</h4>

<p>A structural type is, informally, a type that looks like a value. For
example, the type
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(integer,string,employee)
</pre></div>
<p>is a <em>tuple type</em> &ndash; it denotes the type of a triple of values,
consisting of an <code>integer</code>, a <code>string</code> and an
<code>employee</code> in this case. Values of this tuple type are also
tuples; for example:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">(3,&quot;fred&quot;,employee{name=&quot;peter&quot;. dept:=&quot;sales&quot;})
</pre></div>

<p><strong>Star</strong> has several forms of structural type, the tuple type is one of
them; others include <em>record types</em> and <em>function types</em>.
</p>
<p>We shall see more of these as we introduce the rest of the
language. However, it is worth pausing to ask the question <em>Why</em>?
</p>
<p>Briefly, nominative types help the programmer focus on what a value
<em>denotes</em>; whereas structural types tend to expose what a value
can <em>do</em>.
</p>
<p>For example, the <code>employee</code> type clearly points to what an
employee value is intended to denote (an employee!), but does not help
if we want to know what an employee can do. On the other hand, the
function type in the annotation:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">f : (integer)=&gt;string
</pre></div>

<p>clearly indicates what one can use <code>f</code> for, but it does not
indicate anything about why you would want to (except, perhaps, to
convert an <code>integer</code> to a <code>string</code>).
</p>
<p>In summary, use nominative types when you are modeling real world
entities and structural types when the focus is on operations and
structure more than on what the intention is. In practice, of course,
you will use both in some combination.

<h4 class="subsection">2.3.4 Optional values</h4>
<p>Notice that we identified a special case of <code>noOne</code> in our
<code>Person</code> type. One reason for including this in a type is to be
able to cope with non-existent people. However, this approach is not
always the most effective one when modeling situations where a
variable or field may not have a value.
</p>
<p>Explicit null values, as found in Java and similar languages, cause a
great number of problems: for example, null must have a special
universal type; there are many scenarios where it is not possible for
a variable to be null but the compiler must discover those for itself;
and there is often a consequent tendency in defensive programming to
test for null.
</p>
<p><strong>Star</strong> has no direct equivalent of a global null value. However, the
standard <code>option</code> type allows the equivalent of selective
nullability. Any variable that might not have a proper value can be
marked with the option type rather than the underlying type. And you
can use <code>none</code> in those cases to indicate the equivalent of no
value.
</p>
<p>So, for example, suppose that a <code>Person</code> might have a
<code>spouse</code> &mdash; who is also a <code>Person</code> &mdash; but is not
guaranteed to have one. Such a type can be described using:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">Person ::= someOne{
  name : string.
  dob : date.
  spouse : ref option[Person].
}
</pre></div>

<p>Here we have done two things: we have eliminated the <code>noOne</code> case
for <code>Person</code> and we have marked the <code>spouse</code> as being both
read-write and <code>option</code>al.
</p>
<p>Someone with no spouse would be written:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">freddy = someOne{
  name = &quot;Freddy&quot;.
  dob = today().
  spouse := none
}
</pre></div>

<p>whereas someone who has a spouse would be written:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">someOne{
  name = &quot;Lisa&quot;.
  dob = lastYear.
  spouse := some(johnny)
}
</pre></div>

<p>Of course, we can record <code>freddy</code>âs marriage to <code>lisa</code> using
an assignment:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">freddy.spouse := some(lisa)

lisa.spouse := some(freddy)
</pre></div>
<p>although such circular structures should be avoided where possible.

<h4 class="subsection">2.3.5 The flavors of equality</h4>

<p>Equality in programming languages is typically a very subtle
topic. The issues can range from the nature of floating point numbers,
the difference between integers and long values and the multiple
potential concepts of equality for objects.
</p>
<p>Equality in <strong>Star</strong> is always between values of the <em>same type</em>
and it is always <em>semantic</em>. So, for example, an equality
condition such as:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">3==3.0
</pre></div>
<p>is not considered type safe &mdash; because <code>3</code> is an <code>integer</code>
literal and <code>3.0</code> is a <code>float</code> literal. If you need to
compare an integer and a floating point number for equality you will
need to first of all decide in which type the comparison will be made
(integer or floating point equality) and then <em>coerce</em> the other
value into that type:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">3 :: float == 3.0
</pre></div>
<p>is valid<a name="DOCF11" href="#FOOT11"><sup>11</sup></a>
excepting, of course, that exact comparison between floating point
numbers is not <em>stable</em>.
</p>
<p>This is an important issue because not all integer values can be
represented in a float value and vice-versa. So, comparing an integer
and a floating point value raises the possibility of spurious accuracy
as a result of losing information. The intended effect of the coercion
is to make explicit the nature of equality being relied on.
</p>
<p>The second principle is that equality is semantic. What that means is
that the <code>==</code> symbol is the name of a boolean-valued
function. The precise type of <code>==</code> is quite interesting, we
shall, however, leave it to later when we have covered some of the
core type features around contracts.
</p>
<p>In effect, equality is <em>not</em> considered to be privileged; and it
is definable by the programmer &mdash; albeit with some important useful
default implementations.

<h3 class="section">2.4 A tale of three loops</h3>
<p>Imagine that your task is to add up a list of numbers. Sounds simple
enough: in most procedural or OO languages (such as Java) one would
write a fragment of code that looks like:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">int total = 0;

for(Integer ix:L)
  total += ix;
</pre></div>
<p>However, this code is also full of pitfalls. For one thing we have a
lot of extra detail in this code that represents additional
commitments beyond those we might be comfortable with:
</p>
<ul>
<li> we have had to fix on the type of the number being totaled;
</li><li> we had to know about Javaâs boxed v.s. unboxed types; and
</li><li> we had to construct an explicit loop, with the result that we sequentialized the process of adding up the numbers.
</li></ul>

<p>We can also write an equivalent loop in <strong>Star</strong>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">total = valof do{
  tot := 0;
  for ix in L do
    tot := tot+ix;
  return tot
}
</pre></div>

<p>The valof/return combination is a neat way of segueing from the &lsquo;world
of expressions&rsquo; into the &lsquo;world of actions&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>This program is essentially equivalent to the Java loop; although
there are some subtleties about the nature of valof/valis that go
beyond Java. As a result, it has similar architectural issues.
</p>
<p>While one loop is not going to hurt anyone; real code in languages
like Java typically has many such loops. Especially when nesting loops
to any depth, such code quickly becomes impossible to follow.

</div>
<a name="A-functional-loop-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">2.5 A functional loop</h3>

<p>A more idiomatic way of expressing a computation like the totalizer is
to use a function. For example, we can write:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">let{
  total:(cons[integer])=&gt;integer.
  total(nil) =&gt; 0.
  total(cons(E,L)) =&gt; total(L)+E
} in total(L)
</pre></div>
<p>while short, this code too has some of the same drawbacks as the for iteration.
</p>
<p>The type expression <code>cons[integer]</code> refers to the standard type
of &lsquo;cons lists&rsquo;. Similarly, <code>nil</code> refers to the empty list and
<code>cons(E,L)</code> refers to the list obtained by prepending <code>E</code> to
the list <code>L</code>. We will explore this in more detail in
see <a href="#Functional-Programming">Functional Programming</a>.
</p>
<p>Even if it is more declarative, there is still a lot of extra detail
and architectural commitments here &mdash; like the commitment to
<code>cons</code> lists and the commitment to integers. These result in a
function that is needlessly restricted.
</p>
<p>Like other functional languages, <strong>Star</strong> has a range of higher-order
operators that may come to the rescue. For example, we can avoid the
explicit recursion altogether by using <code>leftFold</code>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">leftFold((+),0,L)
</pre></div>
<p>where <code>leftFold</code> means
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>apply a left associative accumulating function to the elements of the data, assuming that the applied operator is left associative.
</p></blockquote>

<p>This expression is clearly both more concise and higher-level than
either the explicit loop or the explicit recursion; and it begins to
illustrate the productivity gains that are potentially available to
the functional programmer.
</p>
<p>Using <code>leftFold</code> means that we can often abstract away the
machinery of loops and recursion completely &mdash; instead we can solve
the problem at a more holistic level. This is one of the hallmarks of
functional programming &ndash; it is possible to eliminate many instances
of explicit loops and recursions.

<h4 class="subsection">2.5.1 A totalizer query</h4>

<p>While concise, expressions involving much use of <code>leftFold</code> (and
the analogous <code>rightFold</code>) can be difficult to follow. An even
clearer way of adding up numbers is to use a <em>query expression</em>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">{fold X with (+) | X in L}
</pre></div>
<p>This query expression frees us from most of the commitments we endured
before: it can add up the elements of any kind of collection &mdash; not
just <code>cons</code> lists &mdash; and it can add up floating point numbers
just as easily as integers. Finally, we have not had to say exactly
how the numbers should be added up: the language system is free to use
a parallel algorithm for the computation should it be more optimal.
</p>
<p>The query expression is also very close to the natural specification:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Add up the numbers in L
</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Star</strong>âs query expressions &mdash; which are similar to but also more
expressive than LINQ &mdash; can be used to encapsulate a wide range of
such computations. We shall look deeper into them when we look at
query rules in <strong>Star</strong>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, SQL programmers have long had access to this kind of
conciseness and declarative expressiveness. However, SQL is
constrained by the fact that it is intended to represent queries and
actions over a very particular form of data &mdash; the relational table.

<p>Programming is often taught in terms of constructing sequences of
steps that must be followed. What does that imply for the programmer?
It means that the programmer has to be able to imagine what it is like
to be a computer following instructions.
</p>
<p>It is like imagining a little person &mdash; a homunculus &mdash; in the
machine that is listening to your instructions and following them
literally. You, the programmer, have to imagine yourself in the
position of the homunculus if you want to write effective programs in
most languages today.
</p>
<p>Not everyone finds such feats of imagination easy. It is certainly
often tedious to do so. Using query expressions and other higher-order
abstractions significantly reduces the programmerâs burden &mdash;
precisely by being able to take a more declarative approach to
programming.

<h3 class="section">2.6 Contracts and constrained types</h3>

<p>The concepts of interface and contract are foundational in modern
software engineering. This is because explicit interfaces make it
substantially easier to develop and evolve systems. A <strong>Star</strong> contract
goes beyond the traditional concept of interface in important ways: we
do not mark the definition of a type with its implemented contracts
and we allow contracts to involve multiple types.
</p>
<p>A contract defines a collection of signatures and an implementation
provides specific implementations for those functions for a specific
type (or type combination).
</p>
<p>For example, we can imagine a contract for simple four function
calculator arithmetic containing definitions for the basic four
functions of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">contract all t ~~ four[t] ::= {
  plus : (t,t)=&gt;t.
  sub : (t,t)=&gt;t.
  mul : (t,t)=&gt;t.
  div : (t,t)=&gt;t.
}
</pre></div>

<p>This contract defines &mdash; but does not implement &mdash; the four
calculator functions <code>plus</code>, <code>sub</code>, <code>mul</code> and
<code>div</code>. All these functions have a similar type, the type for
<code>plus</code> is:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">plus :  all t ~~ four[t] |: (t,t)=&gt;t.
</pre></div>

<p>The clause <code>four[t] |:</code> is a <em>type constraint</em>, specifically
a <em>contract constraint</em>. So, these functions are generic
(universally quantified) but the bound type (<code>t</code>) has the
additional constraint that there must be an implementation for
<code>four</code> for <code>t</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>four</code> contract defines a set of functions that can be used
without necessarily knowing the type(s) that are involved. For
example, we can define the <code>double</code> function in terms of
<code>plus</code>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">double(X) =&gt; plus(X,X).
</pre></div>

<p>The type of <code>double</code> reflects the fact that we are using elements
from the <code>four</code> contract:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">double : all t ~~ four[t] |: (t)=&gt;t.
</pre></div>
<p>I.e., it inherits the same constraint as the function <code>plus</code>
has. There are several kinds of type constraint in <strong>Star</strong>âs type
system; but the <em>contract constraint</em> is the most significant of
them.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notice that we have to give an explicit type annotation for
<code>double</code>. The reason is that we want to have it have a quantified
type.

<h4 class="subsection">2.6.1 Implementing contracts</h4>

<p>Defining a contract is a big step, but it is not generally sufficient
to produce working programs. If we had a <code>worksheet</code> containing
only:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">worksheet{
  contract all t ~~ four[t] ::= {
    plus : (t,t)=&gt;t.
    sub : (t,t)=&gt;t.
    mul : (t,t)=&gt;t.
    div : (t,t)=&gt;t.
  }

  double : all t ~~ four[t] |: (t)=&gt;t.
  double(X) =&gt; plus(X,X).

  show double(2)
}
</pre></div>

<p>we would get a compiler error along the lines of:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">2:integer
  which is not consistent with
  display[t_12] , four[t_12] |: t_12
  because four[integer] not known to be implemented
</pre></div>

<p>This error message is effectively warning us that we have defined the
<code>four</code> contract but we have not implemented it. Until we do, the
program is not complete. However, if we do supply an implementation of
four over <code>integer</code>s:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">worksheet{
  contract all t ~~ four[t] ::= {
    plus : (t,t)=&gt;t.
    sub : (t,t)=&gt;t.
    mul : (t,t)=&gt;t.
    div : (t,t)=&gt;t.
  }

  double : all t ~~ four[t] |: (t)=&gt;t.
  double(X) =&gt; plus(X,X).

  implementation four[integer] =&gt; {
    plus(x,y) =&gt; x+y.
    sub(x,y) =&gt; x-y.
    mul(x,y) =&gt; x*y.
    div(x,y) =&gt; x/y.
  }

  show double(2)
}
</pre></div>

<p>then everything works as expected.
</p>
<p>Notice that the error message above shows that type t_12 actually has
two type constraints:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">display[t_12] <var>,</var> four[t_12] |: t_12
</pre></div>

<p>This is because the <code>show</code> action also results in a type
constraint being involved. The <code>display</code> contract is used to
display values in a number of circumstances; including the string
formatting we saw above.
</p>
<p>As may be expected, arithmetic itself is also mediated via the
arithmetic contract in <strong>Star</strong>. This is how we can support multiple
numeric types using a common set of operators: there are standard
implementations of arithmetic for integers, and floating point
numbers.

<h4 class="subsection">2.6.2 Coercion, not casting</h4>

<p><strong>Star</strong> does not support automatic type casting, as found in languages
like Java and C/C++. This is for many reasons, not the least of which
is safety and predictability of code.
</p>
<p>Casting in many languages is really two kinds of operations-in-one
which we can refer to as <em>casting</em> and <em>coercion</em>. Casting
is mapping of a value from one type to another without changing the
value itself; and coercion involves converting a value from one type
to another.
</p>
<p>For example, the Java cast expression:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">(Person)X
</pre></div>
<p>amounts to a request to verify that <code>X</code> is actually a
<code>Person</code> object. In particular, this only checks the value of
<code>X</code> to see if it is a <code>Person</code>. On the other hand, casting
an integer to a floating point number involves changing the value to
conform to the floating point representation.
</p>
<p><strong>Star</strong> does not support casting, but does support coercion. However,
coercion in <strong>Star</strong> is never silent or implicit &ndash; as it can be in
Java and C/C++. An expression of the form:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">3+4.5
</pre></div>
<p>will fail to type in <strong>Star</strong> &ndash; because there is an attempt to add an
integer to a floating point number.
</p>
<p>The reason for signaling an error is strongly related to safety and
predictability: automatic conversion of integers to floating point can
be a common source of errors in languages like C &ndash; because such
coercions are not always guaranteed to be semantics preserving (not
all integers can be represented as floating point values). The
implicit coercion of numeric values is easy to miss when reading
arithmetic expressions.
</p>
<p><strong>Star</strong> provides a coercion notation that allows programmers to be
precise in their expectations:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(3 :: float)+4.5
</pre></div>
<p>denotes the explicit coercion of the integer <code>3</code> to a
<code>float</code> and type checks as expected.
</p>
<p>In fact, type coercion in <strong>Star</strong> is mediated via a contract and this
expression is equivalent to
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">(_coerce(3):float)+4.5
</pre></div>
<p>where <code>_coerce</code> is defined in the <code>coercion</code> contract
involving two types:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">contract all s,t ~~ coercion[s,t] ::= {
  _coerce :: (s)=&gt;t
}
</pre></div>

<p>The <code>coercion</code> contract is an interface, but has no analog in
most OO languages: it involves two types &ndash; the source type and the
destination type. Each implementation of coercion specifies both
types. For example, the implementation of coercion between integers
and floating point is explicitly given:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">implementation coercion[integer,float] =&gt; { &hellip; }
</pre></div>
<p>This statement gives the implementation for coercing integers to
floats. Other implementation statements give the definitions for other
forms of coercion.
</p>
<p>Having coercion as a contract makes it straightforward to add new
forms of coercion. This is used quite extensively within <strong>Star</strong>
itself: for example, parsing JSON can be viewed as coercion from
string values to <code>json</code> values. Thus the interface to parsers can
be standard across all types and parsers.

<p>As we have noted, <strong>Star</strong> is a rich language and it would be
impossible to try to cover it in a short introduction. Later chapters
will look at some of the other features such as a deeper look at
contracts, queries &amp; query rules, actors, concurrency, existential
types, and extending <strong>Star</strong> with domain specific languages. The next
chapter (See <a href="#Functional-Programming">Functional Programming</a>) starts this process by looking
at functional programming in <strong>Star</strong>.

<h2 class="chapter">3 Functional Programming</h2>

<p>There is a perception of functional programming that it is
<em>weird</em> and <em>difficult</em>. This is unfortunate for a number of
reasons; the most important being that functional programming is
<em>not</em> weirder than procedural programming and that all
programmers can benefit by programming functionally.
</p>
<p>As for being difficult, a more accurate description would be that
there is a deeper <em>range of features</em> in functional programming
than in most modern programming languages: so a perception of
complexity can arise simply because there is more to say about
functional programming languages. However, the simplest aspects of
functional programming are very simple and the ramp need not be steep.
</p>
<p>What may be surprising to the reader who is not familiar with
functional programming is that it is <em>old</em>: predating the origins
of modern computing itself, that there is a huge amount that can be
expressed functionally, and that functional programming is often at
least as efficient and sometimes more efficient than procedural
programming.
</p>
<p>In this chapter we will show how we can utilize <strong>Star</strong> as a vehicle
for functional programming. As a side-goal, we also hope to demystify
some of the language and ideas found in functional programming.

<h3 class="section">3.1 What is functional programming?</h3>

<p>The foundations of functional programming rest on two principles:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Programs are expressed in terms of functions, where a somewhat
mathematical view of functions is taken; i.e., functions always
produce the same output for the same input.

<p>This is what people mean when they say that functional programs are
<em>declarative</em>.<a name="DOCF12" href="#FOOT12"><sup>12</sup></a>
</p>
</li><li> Functions are values: they can be passed as arguments to functions,
returned from functions, and they can be put into and retrieved from
data structures.
</li></ol>

<p>This last principle is what people mean when they refer to functions
as being <em>first class</em> values. It is also what is meant when we
say that functional programming languages are <em>higher order</em>.
</p>
<p>It is worth asking why these two principles are so important. Although
most early programmers were mathematicians; the extreme constraints
imposed by early machines meant that one might not have seen much
evidence of mathematical thinking in those early programs. However,
almost by accident, programming and mathematics share some attributes:
the importance of <em>composition</em> and the power of
<em>abstraction</em>. Functional programming is almost ideally placed to
exploit both of these to the full.
</p>
<p><strong>Star</strong> is not actually a <em>pure</em> functional programming language;
i.e., it is possible to write programs that violate the declarative
principle. However, it is a <em>functional-first</em> programming language: a
declarative style is strongly encouraged. In this book we shall mostly
focus on writing pure functional programs in <strong>Star</strong>.

<h3 class="section">3.2 Basics</h3>

<p>It is often easier to introduce functional programming using numerical
examples. Last chapter we saw, for example, the factorial
program. This is mostly because most programmers are already familiar
with numbers. Continuing that tradition, here is a function that
returns the sign of a number:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">sign(X) where X&lt;0 =&gt; -1.
sign(0) =&gt; 0.
sign(X) where X&gt;0 =&gt; 1.
</pre></div>

<p>Each of these equations applies to different situations: the first
equation applies when the input argument is negative, the second when
it is exactly zero and the third when it is strictly positive. These
represent the three possible cases in the definition of the sign
function.
</p>
<p>A <strong>Star</strong> function may be built from any number of rewrite equations;
however, they must all be contiguous within the same group of
statements.
</p>
<p>Although it is good practice to ensure that equations in a function
definition do not overlap, <strong>Star</strong> will try the equations in a
function definition in the order they are written in.<a name="DOCF13" href="#FOOT13"><sup>13</sup></a> We could
have relied on this and written &lsquo;sign&lsquo; using:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">sign(X) where X&lt;0 =&gt; -1.
sign(0) =&gt; 0.
sign(X) =&gt; 1.
</pre></div>

<p>Sometimes it is important to mark a particular equation as the
<em>default</em> case: i.e., an equation that should be used if none of the
other cases apply:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">sign(X) where X&lt;0 =&gt; -1.
sign(0) =&gt; 0.
sign(X) default =&gt; 1.
</pre></div>
<p>An explicitly marked &lsquo;default&lsquo; equation does not need to be the last
equation; but, wherever it is written, default equations are only
attempted after all other equations have failed to apply.

<a name="Functions-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.2.1 Functions</h4>
<p>A function is defined as a sequence of <em>rewrite equations</em> each
of which consist of a <em>pattern</em> and an <em>expression</em>. There
are three general forms of rewrite equations:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"><var>Pattern</var> =&gt; <var>Expression</var>
</pre></div>

<p>or
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example"><var>Pattern</var> where <var>Condition</var> =&gt; <var>Expression</var>
</pre></div>

<p>or
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example"><var>Pattern</var> default =&gt; <var>Expression</var>
</pre></div>

<p>The left hand side of a rewrite equation consists of a pattern which
determines the applicability of the equation; and the right hand side
represents the value of the function if the pattern matches.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Pattern:</b> A pattern represents a test or guard on an (implicit) value. Patterns
can be said to succeed or fail depending on whether the value being
tested matches the pattern.
</p></blockquote>

<p>We also refer to a pattern being <em>satisfied</em> when matching a
value.<a name="DOCF14" href="#FOOT14"><sup>14</sup></a>
</p>
<p>The pattern in a rewrite equation is a guard on the arguments of the
function call. For example, given a call
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">sign(34)
</pre></div>
<p>the patterns in the different equations of the <code>sign</code> function
will be applied to the integer value <code>34</code>.
</p>
<p>When the pattern on the left hand side of a rewrite equation succeeds
then the equation <em>fires</em> and the value of the expression on the
right hand side of the equation becomes the value of the function.
</p>
<p>There are many kinds of pattern in <strong>Star</strong>; here, we look at three of
the most common kinds of pattern, and in later sections, we look at
additional forms of patterns.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><em>Variable Pattern</em></dt>
<dd><p>A variable pattern is denoted by an identifier; specifically by the
first occurrence of an identifier.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>A variable pattern always succeeds and has the additional effect of
<em>binding</em> the variable to the value being matched.
</p>
<p>For example, the <code>X</code> in the left hand side of
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">double(X) =&gt; X+X
</pre></div>
<p>is a variable pattern. Binding <code>X</code> means that it is available for
use in the right hand side of the equation &ndash; here to participate in
the expression <code>X+X</code>.
</p>
<p>The part of the program that a variable has value is called its <em>scope</em>.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Variables in rewrite equations always have scope ranging from the
initial occurrence of the variable through to the whole of the right
hand side of the equation.
</li><li> Variable patterns are the <em>only</em> way that a variable can get a
value in <strong>Star</strong>.
</li></ul>

<p>Subsequent occurrences of variables in a pattern are semantically
equivalent to an equality test; specifically a call to the <code>==</code>
predicate. For example, in the equation:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">same(X,X) =&gt; true.
</pre></div>
<p>the second occurrence of <code>X</code> is regarded as an equality test;
i.e., this equation is equivalent to:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">same(X,X1 where X==X1) =&gt; true.
</pre></div>

<p>Sometimes, the earlier occurrence of a variable is not in the pattern
itself but in an outer scope.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><em>Literal Pattern</em></dt>
<dd><p>A literal pattern &ndash; such as a numeric literal or a string literal &ndash; only matches the identical number or string.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Clearly, a literal match amounts to a comparison of two values: the
pattern match succeeds if they are identical and fails otherwise.
</p>
<p>Equality is based on <em>semantic equality</em> rather than
<em>reference equality</em>. What this means, for example, is that two
strings are equal if they have the same sequence of characters in
them, not just if they are the same object in memory.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> not all types admit equality: for example, functions are not
comparable; similarly, implementing equality for circular structures
is problematic.<a name="DOCF15" href="#FOOT15"><sup>15</sup></a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>There is no automatic coercion of values to see if they <em>might</em>
match. In particular, an integer pattern will only match an integer
value and will not match a float value &ndash; even if the numerical values
are the same. I.e., there will be no attempt made to coerce either the
pattern or the value to fit.
</p>
<p>This, too, is based on the desire to avoid hard-to-detect bugs from
leaking into a program.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><em>Guard Pattern</em></dt>
<dd><p>Sometimes known as a <em>semantic guard</em>, a guard pattern consists
of a pair of a pattern and a condition:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"><var>Pattern</var> where <var>Condition</var>
</pre></div>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Conditions are boolean-valued and a guard succeeds if both its pattern
matches and if its condition is <em>satisfied</em>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that conditions <em>may</em> bind variables. This is why we do not state
that conditions are boolean-valued expressions.
</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Star</strong> has a normal complement of special conditional forms which we
shall explore as we encounter the need. In the case of the equation:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">sign(X) where X&gt;0
</pre></div>
<p>the guard pattern is equivalent to:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">X where X&gt;0
</pre></div>
<p>We can put guard pattern anywhere that a pattern is valid; and, for
convenience, we can also put them immediately to the left of the
rewrite equation&rsquo;s <code>=&gt;</code> operator.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any variables that are bound by the pattern part of a guarded pattern
are <em>in scope</em> in the condition part of the guard. Furthermore,
any variables that are bound by the condition part of the guarded
pattern have the same scope as variables introduced in the pattern.
</p></blockquote>

<p>In the pattern above, the variable <code>X</code> will be bound in the
variable pattern <code>X</code> and will then be tested by evaluating the
condition <code>X&gt;0</code>.

</div>
<a name="Order-of-evaluation-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.2.2 Order of evaluation</h4>
<p><strong>Star</strong> is a so-called <em>strict</em> language. What that means is that
arguments to functions are evaluated prior to calling the function.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do not specify the order of evaluation of the arguments of the
function; except that:
</p><ul>
<li> Arguments are evaluated before entry to the function.
</li><li> The function is evaluated before entry to the function.
</li></ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Most programming languages are strict; for two main reasons:
</p>
<ol>
<li> It is significantly easier for programmers to predict the evaluation
characteristics of a strict language.
</li><li> It is also easier to implement a strict language efficiently on modern
hardware. Suffice it to say that modern hardware was designed for
evaluating strict languages, so this argument is somewhat circular.
</li></ol>

<p>There many possible styles of evaluation order; one of the great
merits of programming declaratively is that the order of evaluation
does not affect the actual results of the computation.
</p>
<p>It may, however, affect whether you get a result. Different strategies
for evaluating expressions can easily lead to differences in which
programs terminate and which do not.
</p>
<p>One other kind of evaluation that is often considered is <em>lazy</em>
evaluation. Lazy evaluation means simply that expressions are only
evaluated <em>when needed</em>. Lazy evaluation has many potential
benefits: it certainly enables some very elegant programming
techniques.
</p>
<p>Essentially for the reasons noted above, <strong>Star</strong> does not use lazy
evaluation; however, as we shall see, there are features of <strong>Star</strong>
that allow us to recover some of the power of lazy
evaluation.<a name="DOCF16" href="#FOOT16"><sup>16</sup></a>
</p>
<p>The other dimension in evaluation order relates to the rewrite
equations used to define functions. Here, <strong>Star</strong> uses an in-order
evaluation strategy: the equations that make up the definition of a
function are tried in the order that they are written &ndash; with the one
exception being any default equation which is always tried last.

</div>
<a name="Quantifier-types-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.3.1 Quantifier types</h4>

<p>A <em>generic</em> type is one which has one or more type variables in
it. For example, the type expression:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">(x,x)=&gt;boolean
</pre></div>
<p>is such a generic type (assuming that <code>x</code> is a type variable &ndash;
see below).
</p>
<p>All type variables must be bound by a quantifier in some enclosing
scope. If a type variable is not bound within a particular type
expression, it is considered <em>free</em> in that type expression.
</p>
<p>A <em>quantified type</em> is a type that introduces (i.e., binds) a
type variable. There are two quantifiers in <strong>Star</strong>: a universal
quantifier and an existential quantifier.
</p>
<p>The most common quantifier is the <em>universal quantifier</em> and
universally quantified types correspond closely to generic types in
other languages.
</p>
<p>Universally quantified types are often used to denote function types
and collection types. For example, the type
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">all x ~~ (x,x)=&gt;boolean
</pre></div>
<p>denotes the type of a generic binary function that returns a boolean
value. The standard type for the equality predicate <code>==</code> is
similar to this type.
</p>
<p>A universally quantified type should be read as &lsquo;for all possible
values&rsquo; of the bound variable. For example, this function type should
be read as denoting functions that:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>for any possible type &ndash; <code>x</code> &ndash; the function takes two such
<code>x</code>&rsquo;s and returns a <code>boolean</code>.
</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Star</strong> also supports <em>existentially</em> quantified types &ndash; these
are useful for denoting the types of modules and/or abstract data
types. For example, the type expression:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">exists e ~~ { f1 : e }
</pre></div>
<p>denotes the type of a record with a field &ndash; <code>f1</code> &ndash; which has a
type. The analogous reading for this type expression would be:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there is a type &ndash; <code>x</code> &ndash; such that the record has a field &ndash;
called <code>f1</code> &ndash; of this type.
</p></blockquote>

<p>As may be guessed, this is kind of obscure: <code>f1</code> has a type, but
we don&rsquo;t know much else about it!
</p>
<p>However, existential types can be very useful, especially in
combination with record types like this one. We will leave our more
detailed exploration of existential types for later.

<a name="Contract-constrained-types-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.3.2 Contract constrained types</h4>
<p>We noted above that the type of the standard equality predicate was
almost the same as:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">all x ~~ (x,x)=&gt;boolean
</pre></div>
<p>This type denotes a universally quantified function type that can be
applied to arguments of any given type. However, equality in a normal
programming language is <em>not</em> universal: not all values admit to
being reliably tested for equality. A great example of such a
limitation are functions &ndash; equality between functions is not well
defined.<a name="DOCF17" href="#FOOT17"><sup>17</sup></a>
</p>
<p>To capture this, we need to be able to constrain the scope of the
quantifier; specifically to those argument types that do admit
equality.
</p>
<p>We can do this by adding a <em>contract constraint</em> to the type &ndash;
the constraint states that equality must be defined for the type. We
do this by prepending an <code>equality</code> constraint clause to the
type:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">all x ~~ equality[x] |: (x,x)=&gt;boolean
</pre></div>
<p>The <code>equality[x] |:</code> clause states that the type variable
<code>x</code> must satisfy the <code>equality</code> contract.
</p>
<p>What is implied when we state this? This is captured in the definition
of the contract itself, in this case:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">contract all t ~~ equality[t] ::= {
  (==) : (t,t) =&gt; boolean.
}
</pre></div>
<p>In effect, the <code>equality</code> contract states that there must be a
single function defined &ndash; <code>==</code> &ndash; that is defined for any type that
claims to satisfy the <code>equality</code> contract.
</p>
<p>If this seems a little circular, it is not. The <code>equality</code>
contract is effectively saying that the <code>==</code> function must be
defined for the type; and we constrain function (and other) types with
the <code>equality</code> contract constraint when we need to ensure that
<code>==</code> is defined!
</p>
<p>We provide evidence for contracts through the <code>implementation</code>
statement. This declares that a given type satisfies a contract by
providing implementations for the functions in the contract.
</p>
<p>For example, we can provide evidence that the <code>equality</code> contract
applies to strings using a built-in primitive to actually implement
equality for strings:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">implementation equality[string] =&gt; {
  s1 == s2 =&gt; _string_eq(s1,s2).
}
</pre></div>
<p>We shall explore more fully the power of this form of type constraint
in later sections and chapters. For now, the core concept is that
quantified types can be constrained to allow very precise formulations
of types.

simultaneously: it introduces a new type into scope, it gives an
enumeration of the legal values of the new type and it defines both
constructors for the values and it defines patterns for decomposing
values. This is a lot for a single statement to do!
</p>
<p>For example, we can define a type that denotes a point in a
two-dimensional space:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">point ::= cart(float,float).
</pre></div>
<p>This kind of statement is called a <em>type definition statement</em>
and is legal in the same places that a function definition is legal.
</p>
<p>The new type that is named by this statement is point; so, a variable
may have point type, we can pass point values in functions and so on.
</p>
<p>The constructor cart allows us to have expression that allow new
point structures to be made:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">cart(3.4,2.1)
</pre></div>
<p><code>cart</code> is also the name of a <em>pattern</em> operator that we can
use to take apart point values. For example, the euclid function
computes the Euclidian distance associated with a point:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">euclid:(point)=&gt;float.
euclid(cart(X,Y)) =&gt; sqrt(X*X+Y*Y).
</pre></div>
<p>Of course, this particular <code>point</code> type is based on the
assumption that point values are represented in a cartesian coordinate
system. One of the more powerful aspects of algebraic data types is
that it is easy to introduce multiple alternate forms of data. For
example, we might want to support two forms of point: in cartesian
coordinates and in polar coordinates. We can do this by introducing
another case in the type definition statement:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">point ::= cart(float,float)
        | polar(float,float).
</pre></div>
<p>Of course, our <code>euclid</code> function also needs updating with the new
case:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">euclid:(point)=&gt;float.
euclid(cart(X,Y)) =&gt; sqrt(X*X+Y*Y).
euclid(polar(R,T)) =&gt; R.
</pre></div>
<p><code>cart</code> and <code>polar</code> are called <em>constructor
functions</em>. The term <em>constructor</em> refers to the common
programming concept of constructing data structures. They are called
functions because, logically, they <em>are</em> functions.
</p>
<p>For example, we might give a type to <code>polar</code>:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">polar : (float,float)=&gt;point
</pre></div>
<p>In fact, constructor functions are one-to-one functions. Variously
known as <em>free functions</em> (in logic), <em>bijections</em> (in
Math), one-to-one functions are guaranteed to have an inverse. This is
the logical property that makes constructor functions useful for
representing data.
</p>
<p>Of course, we are talking of a <em>logical</em> property of constructor
functions. Internally, when implementing functional languages like
<strong>Star</strong>, the values returned by constructor functions are represented
using data laid out in memory &ndash; just like in any other programming
language.
</p>
<p><strong>Star</strong> actually uses a special type for constructor functions; so
the correct type of <code>polar</code> is given by:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">polar : (float,float)&lt;=&gt;point
</pre></div>
<p>The double arrow representing the fact that constructor functions are
bijections.
</p>
<p>In addition to constructor functions, an algebraic type definition can
introduce two other forms of data: <em>enumerated symbols</em> and
<em>record functions</em>. Enumerated symbols are quite useful in
representing symbolic alternatives. The classic example of an
enumerated type is <code>daysOfWeek</code>:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">daysOfWeek ::= monday
             | tuesday
             | wednesday
             | thursday
             | friday
             | saturday
             | sunday.
</pre></div>
<p>Another example is the standard <code>boolean</code> type which is defined:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">boolean ::= true | false.
</pre></div>
<p>Unlike enumerated symbols in some languages, there is no numeric value
associated with an enumeration symbol: an enumerated symbol &lsquo;stands
for&rsquo; itself only. The reason for this will become clear in our next
type definition which mixes enumerated symbols with constructor
functions:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">sTree ::= sEmpty | sNode(sTree,string,sTree)
</pre></div>
<p>In addition to mixing the enumerated symbol (<code>sEmpty</code>) with the
<code>sNode</code> constructor, this type is <em>recursive</em>: in fact, this
is a classic binary tree type where the labels of the non-empty nodes
are strings. (We shall see shortly how to generalize this).
</p>
<p>Whenever you have a recursive type, its definition must always include
one or more cases that are not recursive and which can form the base
case(s). In that sense, an enumerated symbol like <code>sEmpty</code> plays
a similar role in <strong>Star</strong> as null does in other languages; except that
<code>sEmpty</code> is only associated with the sTree type.
</p>
<p>We can use <code>sTree</code> to construct binary trees of string value; for
example:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">sNode(sNode(sEmpty,&quot;alpha&quot;,sEmpty),
      &quot;beta&quot;,
      sNode(sEmpty,&quot;gamma&quot;,sEmpty))
</pre></div>
<p>denotes the tree in:
</p>
<div class="float"><a name="binaryStringTree"></a>

<img src="images/sTree.jpg" alt="images/sTree">
<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Figure 3.1: </strong>A Binary string Tree</p></div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the hallmarks of languages like <strong>Star</strong> is that <em>every</em>
value has a legal syntax: it is possible to construct an expression
that denotes a literal value of any type.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Just as we can define <code>sTree</code> values, so we can also define
functions over <code>sTree</code>s. For example, the <code>check</code> function
returns <code>true</code> if a given tree contains a particular search term:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">check(sEmpty,_) =&gt; false.
check(sNode(L,Lb,R),S) =&gt; Lb==S || check(L,S) || check(R,S).
</pre></div>
<p>Here we see several new aspects of <strong>Star</strong> syntax:
</p>
<ul>
<li> An empty pattern &ndash; marked by <code>_</code> &ndash; matches anything. It is
called the <em>anonymous pattern</em> and is used whenever we don&rsquo;t care
about the actual content of the data.
</li><li> The <code>||</code> disjunction is a <em>short-circuit</em> disjunction; much
like <code>||</code> in languages like Java. Similarly, conjunction
(<code>&amp;&amp;</code>) is also short-circuiting.
</li><li> Functions can be recursive. <strong>Star</strong> permits <em>mutual recursion</em>
just as easily: there is no special requirement to order function
definitions in a program.
</li></ul>

<p>We can use <code>sTest</code> to check for the occurrence of particular
strings:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">T = sNode(sNode(sEmpty,&quot;alpha&quot;,sEmpty),
          &quot;beta&quot;,
          sNode(sEmpty,&quot;gamma&quot;,sEmpty)).

show check(T,&quot;alpha&quot;).          -- results in true
show check(T,&quot;delta&quot;).          -- results in false
</pre></div>

<a name="Functions-as-values-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.4 Functions as values</h3>
<p>The second principle of functional programming is that functions are
first class. What that means is that we can have functions that are
bound to variables, passed into functions and returned as the values
of functions. In effect, a function is a legal <em>expression</em> in
the language. It also means that we can have <em>function types</em> in
addition to having types about data.
</p>
<p>We can see this best by looking at a few examples. One of the benefits
of passing functions as arguments to other functions is that it makes
certain kinds of parameterization easy. For example, suppose that you
wanted to generalize <code>check</code> to apply an arbitrary test to each
node &ndash; rather than just looking for a particular string.
</p>
<p>We will first of all define our <code>fTest</code> function itself:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">fTest:(sTree,(string)=&gt;boolean)=&gt;boolean.
fTest(sEmpty,_) =&gt; false.
fTest(sNode(L,Lb,R),F) =&gt; F(Lb) || fTest(L,F) || fTest(R,F).
</pre></div>
<p>The substantial change here is that, rather than passing a string to
look for, we pass <code>fTest</code> a boolean-valued function to apply;
within <code>fTest</code> we replace the equality test <code>Lb==S</code> with a
call <code>F(Lb)</code>.
</p>
<p>Notice that the type annotation for <code>fTest</code> shows that the type
of the second argument is a function type &ndash; from <code>string</code> to
<code>boolean</code>.
</p>
<p>Given <code>fTest</code>, we can redefine our earlier <code>check</code> function
with:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">check(T,S) =&gt; fTest(T,(X)=&gt;X==S).
</pre></div>
<p>We have a new form of expression here: the <em>anonymous function</em>
or <em>lambda expression</em>. The expression
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">(X)=&gt;X==S
</pre></div>
<p>denotes a function of one argument, which returns <code>true</code> if its
argument is the same value as <code>S</code>.
</p>
<p>Interestingly, it would be difficult to define a top-level function
that is equivalent to this lambda because of the occurrence of the
variable <code>S</code> in the body of the lambda. This is an example of a
<em>free variable</em>: a variable that is mentioned in the body of a
function but which is defined outside the function. Because <code>S</code>
is free, because it is not mentioned in the arguments, one cannot
simply have a function which is equivalent to the lambda as a
top-level function.
</p>
<p>Free variables are a powerful feature of functional programming
languages because they have an <em>encapsulating</em> effect: in this
case the lambda encapsulates the free variable so that the
<code>fTest</code> function does not need knowledge of <code>S</code>.

<h4 class="subsection">3.4.1 Functions and closures</h4>
<p>If a function is an expression, what is the value of the function
expression? The conventional name for this value is <em>closure</em>:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><em>Closure</em></dt>
<dd><p>A closure is a structure that is the value of a function expression and which may be applied to arguments.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>It is important to note that, as a programmer, you will never &lsquo;see&rsquo; a
closure in your program. It is an implementation artifact in the same
way that the representation of floating point numbers is an
implementation artifact that allow computers to represent fractional
numbers but which programmers (almost) never see explicitly in
programs.
</p>
<p>Pragmatically, one of the important roles of closures is to capture
any free variables that occur in the function. Most functional
programming languages implement functions using closure
structures. Most functional programming languages (including <strong>Star</strong>)
do not permit direct manipulation of the closure structure: the only
thing that you can <em>do</em> with a closure structure is to use it as
a function.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the world of programming languages, there is a lot of confusion
about closures. Sometimes you will see a closure referring to a
function that captures one or more free variables.

<h4 class="subsection">3.4.2 Let binding</h4>

<p>We noted that it is difficult to achieve the effect of the
<code>(X)=&gt;X==S</code> lambda expression with named functions. The reason is
that the lambda is <em>not</em> defined in the same way that named
functions are defined &ndash; because it occurs as an expression not as a
statement. If we wanted to define a named function which also captures
<code>S</code>, we would have to be able to define functions inside
expressions.
</p>
<p>There is an expression that allows us to do this: the <code>let</code>
expression. A <code>let</code> expression allows us to introduce local
definitions anywhere within an expression. We can define our lambda as
the named function <code>isS</code> using the <code>let</code> expression:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">let{
  isS(X) =&gt; X==S
} in isS
</pre></div>
<p>The region between the braces is a <em>definition environment</em> and
<strong>Star</strong> allows <em>any</em> definition statement to be in such an
environment. We can define check using a let expression:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">check(T,S) =&gt; fTest(T,
    let{
      isS(X) =&gt; X==S.
    } in isS)
</pre></div>
<p>This is a somewhat long-winded way of achieving what we did with the
anonymous lambda function &ndash; we would not normally recommend this way
of writing the <code>check</code> function as it is significantly more
complicated than our earlier version. However, there is a strong
inter-relationship between anonymous lambdas, let expressions and
variable definitions. In particular, these are equivalent:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">let{
  isS = (X) =&gt; X==S
} in isS
</pre></div>
<p>and
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">(X)=&gt;X==S
</pre></div>
<p>Apart from being long-winded, the <code>let</code> expression is
significantly more flexible than a simple lambda. It is much easier
within a <code>let</code> expression to define functions with more than one
rewrite equation; or to define multiple functions. We can even define
types within the let binding environment.
</p>
<p>Conversely, lambda functions are so compact because they have strong
limitations: you cannot easily define a multi-rewrite equation
function with a lambda and you cannot easily define a recursive
function as a lambda.
</p>
<p>In short, we would use a <code>let</code> expression when the function being
defined is at all complex; and we would use a lambda when the function
being defined is simple and small.
</p>
<p>Assembling functions in this way, either by using anonymous lambdas or
by using <code>let</code> expressions, is one of the hallmarks of functional
programming.

<h4 class="subsection">3.4.3 Generic types</h4>

<p>What actually makes <code>fTest</code> more constrained than it could be is
the type definition of <code>sTree</code> itself. It too is unnecessarily
restrictive: why not allow trees of any type? We can, using the type
definition for <code>tree</code>:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">all t ~~ tree[t] ::= tEmpty | tNode(tree[t],t,tree[t]).
</pre></div>
<p>Like the original <code>sTree</code> type definition, this statement
introduces a new type: <code>tree[t]</code> which can be read as <em>tree
of something</em>. The name <code>tree</code> is not actually a type identifier
&ndash; although we often refer to the tree type &ndash; but it is a <em>type
constructor</em>.
</p>
<p>In an analogous fashion to constructor functions, a type constructor
constructs types from other types. Type constructors are even
bijections &ndash; one-to-one functions from types to types.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike constructor functions though, type functions play no part in
the run-time evaluation of programs.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The identifier <code>t</code> in the type definition for <code>tree</code> denotes
a <em>type variable</em>. Again, similarly to regular variables and
parameters, a type variable denotes a single unspecified type. The
role of the type variable <code>t</code> is like a parameter in a function:
it identifies the unknown type and its role.
</p>
<p>The <code>tree</code> type is a universally quantified type. What that means
is that instead of defining a single type it defines a family of
related types: for example:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">tree[string]
tree[integer]
&hellip;
</pre></div>

<p>are <code>tree</code> types. We can even have trees of trees:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">tree[tree[string]]
</pre></div>
<p>We capture this genericity of the tree type by using a <em>universal
quantifier</em>:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">all t ~~ tree[t]
</pre></div>
<p>What this type expression denotes is a set of possible types: for any
type <code>t</code>, <code>tree[t]</code> is also a type. There are infinitely
many such types of course.
</p>
<p>The <code>all</code> quantifier is important: as in logic, there are two
kinds of quantifiers in <strong>Star</strong>&rsquo;s type system: the <em>universal</em>
quantifier all and the <em>existential</em> quantifier exists.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Star</strong> uses context to determine whether any given identifier is a
type variable or a type name. Specifically, if an identifier is bound
by a quantifier then it must refer to a type variable.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The types of the two constructors introduced in the <code>tree</code> type
definition are similarly quantified:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">tEmpty:all t ~~ tree[t].

tNode:all t ~~ (tree[t],t,tree[t)]&lt;=&gt;tree[t].
</pre></div>
<p>The type <code>tree[t]</code> on the right hand side of <code>tEmpty</code>&rsquo;s type
annotation raises a couple of interesting points:
</p>
<ol>
<li> This looks like a type annotation with no associated definition. The
fact that the <code>tEmpty</code> symbol was originally introduced in a type
definition is enough of a signal for the compiler to avoid looking for
a definition for the name.

</li><li> The type of a literal <code>tEmpty</code> expression &ndash; assuming that no
further information is available &ndash; will be of the form
<code>tree[t34]</code> where <code>t34</code> is a &lsquo;new&rsquo; type variable not
occurring anywhere else in the program. In effect, the type of
<code>tEmpty</code> is tree of <em>some type</em> <code>t34</code> where we don&rsquo;t
know anything more about <code>t34</code>.
</li></ol>

<h4 class="subsection">3.4.4 Generic functions</h4>
<p>Given this definition of the tree type, we can construct a more
general form of the tree test function; which is almost identical to
fTest:<a name="DOCF18" href="#FOOT18"><sup>18</sup></a>
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">test:all t ~~ (tree[t],(t)=&gt;boolean)=&gt;boolean.

test(tNode(L,Lb,R),F) =&gt; F(Lb) || test(L,F) || test(R,F).

<p>and our original string check function becomes:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">check(T,S) =&gt; test(T,(X) =&gt; X==S)
</pre></div>
<p>The type of check is also more generic:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">check:all t ~~ (tree[t],t)=&gt;boolean
</pre></div>
<p>I.e., <code>check</code> can be used to find any type of element in a tree
&ndash; providing that the types align of course.
</p>
<p>Actually, this is not the correct the type for check. This is because
we do not, in general, know that the type can support equality. The
precise type for check should take this into account:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">check:all t ~~ equality[t] |: (tree[t],t) =&gt; boolean

<h3 class="section">3.5 Going further</h3>
<p>Although better than the original <code>sTest</code> program there is still
one major sense in which the test program is not general enough. We
can see this by looking at another example: a function that counts
elements in the tree:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">count:all t ~~ (tree[t]) =&gt; integer.
count(tEmpty) =&gt; 0.
count(tNode(L,_,R)) =&gt; count(L)+count(R)+1
</pre></div>
<p>This code is very similar, but not identical, to the <code>test</code>
function.
</p>
<p>The issue is that <code>test</code> is trying to do two things
simultaneously: in order to apply its test predicate to a binary tree
it has to implement a walk over the tree, and it also encodes the fact
that the function we are computing over the tree is a boolean-value
function.
</p>
<p>We often need to do all kinds of things to our data structures and
writing this kind of recursion over and over again is tedious and
error prone. What we would like to do is to write a single
<em>visitor</em> function and specialize it appropriately when we want
to perform a specific function.
</p>
<p>This principle of separating out the different aspects of a system is
one of the core foundations of good software engineering. It usually
goes under the label <em>separation of concerns</em>. One of the
beautiful things about functional programming is that it directly
supports such good architectural practices.
</p>
<p>Since this visitor may be asked to perform any kind of computation on
the labels in the tree we will need to slightly generalize the type of
function that is passed to the visitor. Specifically, the type of
function should look like:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">F : (a,t)=&gt;a
</pre></div>
<p>where the <code>a</code> input represents accumulated state, <code>t</code>
represents an element of the tree and the result is another
accumulation.
</p>
<p>Using this, we can write a <code>tVisit</code> function that implements tree
walking as:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">tVisit:all a,t ~~ (tree[t],(a,t)=&gt;a,a)=&gt;a.
tVisit(tEmpty,_,A) =&gt; A.
tVisit(tNode(L,Lb,R),F,A) =&gt; tVisit(R,F,F(tVisit(L,F,A),Lb)).
</pre></div>
<p>Just as the accumulating function acquires a new &lsquo;state&rsquo; parameter, so
the <code>tVisit</code> function also does. The <code>A</code> parameter in the
two equations represents this accumulated state.
</p>
<p>The second rewrite equation for <code>tVisit</code> is a bit dense so let us
open it out and look more closely. A more expanded way of writing the
<code>tVisit</code> function would be:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">tVisit(tEmpty,_,A) =&gt; A.
tVisit(tNode(L,Lb,R),F,A) =&gt; let{
  A1 = tVisit(L,F,A).
  A2 = F(A1,Lb).
  } in tVisit(R,F,A2)
</pre></div>
<p>where <code>A1</code> and <code>A2</code> are two local variables that represent
the result of visiting the left sub-tree and applying the accumulator
function respectively. We have used the let expression form to make
the program more obvious, rather than to introduce new functions
locally; but this is a legitimate role for let expressions.
</p>
<p>The <code>tVisit</code> function knows almost nothing about the computation
being performed, all it knows about is how to walk the tree and it
knows to apply functions to labels in the tree.
</p>
<p>Given <code>tVisit</code>, we can implement our original <code>check</code> and
<code>count</code> functions as one-liners:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">check(T,S) =&gt; tVisit(T,(A,X)=&gt;(A || X==S),false).
count(T) =&gt; tVisit(T,(A,X)=&gt;A+1,0).
</pre></div>
<p>The lambda that is embedded in the definition of check bears a little
closer scrutiny:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">(A,X)=&gt;(A || X==S)
</pre></div>
<p>In this lambda, we return <code>A</code> &ndash; if it is <code>true</code> &ndash; or we
return the result of the test <code>X==S</code>. This is a common pattern in
such programs: the accumulator <code>A</code> acts as a kind of state
parameter that keeps track of whether we have already found the value.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Functional programs are not actually <em>state-free</em>; often quite
the opposite. However, the state in a functional program is never
<em>hidden</em>. This is the true distinction between functional and
regular procedural programs.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Notice that we have effectively hidden the recursion in the function
definitions of <code>check</code> and <code>count</code> &ndash; all the recursion is
encapsulated within the <code>tVisit</code> function.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the unofficial mantras of functional programming is <em>hide
the recursion</em>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The reason we want to hide recursions that this allows the designer of
functions to focus on <em>what</em> is being computed rather than
focusing on the structure of the data and, furthermore, this allows
the implementation of the visitor to be <em>shared</em> by all users of
the tree type.
</p>
<p>Notice that, while <code>a</code> and <code>t</code> are type variables, we did
not put an explicit quantifier on the type of <code>F</code>. This is
because the quantifier is actually put on the type of <code>tVisit</code>
instead:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">tVisit:all a,t ~~ (tree[t],(a,t)=&gt;a,a)=&gt;a
</pre></div>
<p>Just like regular variables, type variables have scope and points of
introduction. Also like regular variables, a type variable may be
<em>free</em> in a given type expression; although it must ultimately be
<em>bound</em> by a quantifier.

<h4 class="subsection">3.5.1 Going even further</h4>
<p>We have focused so far on generalizing the visitor from the
perspective of the tree type. But there is another sense in which we
are still <em>architecturally entangled</em>: from the perspective of
the <code>check</code> and <code>count</code> functions themselves.
</p>
<p>In short, they are both tied to our <code>tree</code> type. However, there
are many possible collection data types; <strong>Star</strong> for instance has some
5 or 6 different standard collection types. We would prefer not to
have to re-implement the <code>check</code> and <code>count</code> functions for
each type.
</p>
<p>The good news is that, using contracts, we can write a single
definition of <code>check</code> and <code>count</code> that will work for a range
of collection types.
</p>
<p>Let us start by defining a contract that encapsulates what it means to
visit a collection:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">contract all c,t ~~ visitor[c-&gt;&gt;t] ::= {
  visit:all a ~~ (c,(a,t)=&gt;a,a)=&gt;a
}
</pre></div>
<p>This <code>visitor</code> contract defines a single function that embodies
what it means to <em>visit</em> a collection structure. There are quite
a few pieces here, and it is worth examining them carefully.
</p>
<p>A contract header has a template that defines a form of <em>contract
constraint</em>. The clause
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">visitor[c -&gt;&gt; t]
</pre></div>
<p>is such a constraint. The sub-clause
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">c -&gt;&gt; t
</pre></div>
<p>refers to two types: <code>c</code> and <code>t</code>. The presence of the
<code>-&gt;&gt;</code> term identifies the fact that <code>t</code> <em>depends</em> on
<code>c</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>visitor</code> contract itself is about the collection type
<code>c</code>. But, within the contract, we need to refer to both the
collection type and to the type of elements in the collection: the
<code>visit</code> function is over the collection, it applies a function to
elements of the collection.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, as we design the contract, we <em>do not know</em> the
exact relationship between the collection type and the element
type. For example, the collection type may be generic in one argument
type &ndash; in which case the element type is likely that argument type;
conversely, if the type is <em>not</em> generic (like <code>string</code>
say), then we have no direct handle on the element type.
</p>
<p>We <em>do know</em> that within the contract the element type is
<em>functionally determined</em> by the collection type: if you know the
collection type then you should be able to figure out the element
type.
</p>
<p>We express this dependency relationship with the the <code>c -&gt;&gt; t</code>
form: whatever type <code>c</code> is, <code>t</code> must be based on it.
</p>
<p>The body of the contract contains a single type annotation:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">visit:all a ~~(c,(a,t)=&gt;a,a)=&gt;a
</pre></div>
<p>This type annotation has three type variables: the types <code>c</code> and
<code>t</code> come from the contract header and <code>a</code> is local to the
signature. What the signature means is
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given the visitor contract, the <code>visit</code> function is from the
collection type <code>c</code>, a function argument and an initial state and
returns a new accumulation state.
</p></blockquote>

<p>It is worth comparing the type of <code>visit</code> with the type of
<code>tVisit</code>:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">tVisit:all t,a ~~(tree[t],(a,t)=&gt;a,a)=&gt;a
</pre></div>
<p>The most significant difference here is that in <code>tVisit</code> the type
of the first argument is fixed to <code>tree[t]</code> whereas in
<code>visit</code> it is left simply as <code>c</code> (our collection type).
</p>
<p>Given this contract, we can re-implement our two <code>check</code> and
<code>count</code> functions even more succinctly:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">check(T,S) =&gt; visit(T, (A,X)=&gt;A || X==S,false)
count(T) =&gt; visit(T, (A,X)=&gt;A+1,0)
</pre></div>
<p>These functions will apply to <em>any</em> type that satisfies &ndash; or
implements &ndash; the <code>visitor</code> contract. This is made visible in the
revised type signature for <code>count</code>:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">count:all c,t ~~ visitor[c-&gt;&gt;t] |: (c)=&gt;integer.
</pre></div>
<p>This type is an example of a <em>constrained type</em>. It is generic in
<code>c</code> and <code>t</code> but that generality is constrained by the
requirement that the <code>visitor</code> contract is appropriately
implemented. The eagled-eyed reader will notice that <code>count</code> does
not actually depend on the type of the elements in the collection:
this is what we should expect since <code>count</code> does not actually
care about the elements themselves.
</p>
<p>The type signature for <code>check</code>, however, does care about the
types of the elements:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">check:all c,t ~~
  visitor[c-&gt;&gt;t], equality[c] |: (c,t)=&gt;boolean
</pre></div>
<p>This type annotation now has two contract constraints associated with
it: the collection must be something that is visitable and the
elements of the collection must support <code>equality</code>.
</p>
<p>Given the work we have done, we can implement the <code>visitor</code>
contract for our <code>tree[t]</code> type quite straightforwardly:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">implementation all t ~~ visitor[tree[t]-&gt;&gt;t] =&gt; {
  visit = tVisit
}
</pre></div>
<p>Notice that header of the implementation statement provides the
connection between the collection type (which is <code>tree[t]</code>) with
the element type (<code>t</code>). The clause
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">visitor[tree[t]-&gt;&gt;t]
</pre></div>
<p>is effectively a declaration of that connection.
</p>
<p>Now that we have disconnected <code>visit</code> from <code>tree</code> types, we
can extend our program by implementing it for other types. In
particular, we could also implement the visitor for the <code>sTree</code>
type:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">implementation visitor[sTree -&gt;&gt; string] =&gt; {
  visit = sVisit
}
</pre></div>
<p>however, we leave the definition of <code>sVisit</code> as a simple exercise
for the reader.
</p>
<p>Our final versions of <code>count</code> and <code>check</code> are now quite
general: they rely on a generic implementation of the <code>visit</code>
function to hide the recursion and are effectively independent of the
actual collection types involved.
</p>
<p>If we take a second look at our visitor contract we can see something
quite remarkable: it counts as a definition of the famous
<em>visitor pattern</em>. This is remarkable because, although visitor
patterns are a common design pattern in OO languages, it is often hard
in those languages to be crisp about the semantics of visiting; in
fact, they are called patterns because they represent patterns of use
which may be encoded in Java (say) whilst not necessarily being
definable in them.
</p>
<p>The combination of contract and implementation represents a quite
formal way of defining patterns like the visitor pattern.
</p>
<p>There is something else here that is quite important too: we are able
to define and implement the visitor contract <em>without</em> having to
modify in any way the type definition of <code>tree</code> or
<code>sTree</code>. From a software engineering point of view this is quite
important: we are able to gain all the benefits of interfaces without
needing to entangle them with our types. This becomes critical in
situations where we are not able to modify types &ndash; because they don&rsquo;t
belong to us and/or we don&rsquo;t have access to the source.

<a name="Polymorphic-arithmetic-1"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.6 Polymorphic arithmetic</h3>
<p>There are other ways in which programs can be polymorphic. In
particular, let us focus for a while on arithmetic. One of the issues
in arithmetic functions is that there are many different kinds of
numbers. Pretty much every programming language distinguishes several
kinds of numbers; for example, Java distinguishes byte, short, int,
long, float, double, BigInteger and BigDecimal &ndash; and this does not
count the wrapped versions. Other languages have even more choice.
</p>
<p>One question that might seem relevant is why? The basic answer is that
different applications call for different properties of numbers and no
one numeric type seems to fit all needs. However, that variety comes
at a cost: when we use numbers we tend to have to make too early a
choice for the numeric type.
</p>
<p>For example, consider the <code>double</code> function we saw earlier:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">double(X) =&gt; X+X
</pre></div>
<p>What type should <code>double</code> have? In particular, what should the
type of <code>+</code> be? Most people would be reluctant to use different
arithmetic operators for different types of numbers.<a name="DOCF19" href="#FOOT19"><sup>19</sup></a> This is resolved in
<strong>Star</strong> by relying on contracts for the arithmetic operations.
</p>
<p>The result is that the most appropriate type signature for
<code>double</code> is exquisitely tuned:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">double:all t ~~ arith[t] |: (t)=&gt;t
</pre></div>
<p>This type is precisely the most general type that <code>double</code> could
have. Any further constraints result in making a potentially premature
choice for the numeric type.
</p>
<p>If we take another look at our original <code>fact</code> function:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">fact(0) =&gt; 1
fact(N) =&gt; N*fact(N-1)
</pre></div>
<p>this is constrained to be a function from <code>integer</code> to
<code>integer</code> because we introduced the literal integers <code>0</code> and
<code>1</code>. However, the <code>arith</code> contract contains synonyms for
these very common literals. Using <code>zero</code> and <code>one</code> allow us
to be abstract in many arithmetic functions:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">genFact:all a ~~ arith[a] |: (a)=&gt;a.
genFact(zero) =&gt; one.
genFact(N) =&gt; N*genFact(N-one).
</pre></div>
<p>We call out <code>zero</code> and one for special treatment because they
occur very frequently in numerical functions. We can introduce other
numeric literals without compromising our type by using
<em>coercion</em>; although it is more clumsy:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">factorialC:all t ~~
  arith[t],coercion[integer,t] |: (t)=&gt;t.
factorialC(N) where N==0::t =&gt; 1::t.
factorialC(N) =&gt; N*factorialC(N-1::t).
</pre></div>
<p>The expressions <code>0::t</code> and <code>1::t</code> are coercions from
<code>integer</code> to <code>t</code>.
</p>
<p>Of course, coercion is also governed by contract, a fact represented
in the type signature by the coercion contract constraints on the type
of <code>t</code>.
</p>
<p>In any case, using these techniques, it is possible to write numeric
functions without unnecessarily committing to specific number
types. That in turn helps to make them more useful.

<h4 class="subsection">3.6.1 Optional computing</h4>
<p>There are many situations where it is not possible to guarantee that a
computation will succeed. The simplest examples of this include
scenarios such as accessing external files; but may also apply to
getting the first element of a list or the label of a <code>tree</code>
node. The great unknown of accessing elements of a collection is &lsquo;is
it there?&rsquo;. Its not guaranteed of course, and we need to be able to
handle failure.
</p>
<p>Many languages employ the concept of a special <code>null</code> value to
denote some of these cases &ndash; like a <code>someOne</code> not having a
<code>spouse</code>. However, the special <code>null</code> value brings its own
problems: the type of <code>null</code> is problematic (it is a legal value
for every type) and there are many situations where <code>null</code> is
never possible.
</p>
<p>We address this by handling those situations where failure is possible
differently than where it is not. Specifically, we do this via the
<code>option</code> type.
</p>
<p>The type definition of <code>option</code> is quite straightforward:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">all t ~~ option[t] ::= none | some(t).
</pre></div>
<p>where <code>none</code> is intended to denote the non-existence of a value
and <code>some</code> denotes an actual value.
</p>
<p>The <code>option</code> type is intended to be used in cases where functions
are known to be partial.<a name="DOCF20" href="#FOOT20"><sup>20</sup></a> An <code>option</code>
return type signals that the function may not always have a value.
</p>
<p>Normal pattern matching can be used to access a value wrapped in a
<code>some</code>; for example, to access someone&rsquo;s <code>spouse</code> we can use
the condition:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">isMarriedTo(P,J) where some(JJ).=P.spouse =&gt; J==JJ.
isMarriedTo(_,_) default =&gt; false.
</pre></div>
<p>The important detail here is that all access to a <code>option</code>
wrapped value is gated by some form of pattern matching and that,
normally, this takes place in a condition.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The condition
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">some(JJ).=P.spouse
</pre></div>
<p>represents a pattern matching condition: it is satisfied if
<code>P.spouse</code> matches <code>some(JJ)</code> and has the additional effect
of defining and binding the variable <code>JJ</code> to the matched spouse.
</p></blockquote>

</div>
<a name="Special-syntax-for-optional-values-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.6.2 Special syntax for <code>option</code>al values</h4>
<p>Of course, the code above <em>is</em> kind of clumsy! There is a range
of operators in <strong>Star</strong> to make using <code>option</code> values more
pleasant.
</p>
<p>The most important of these is the <code>^=</code> operator which combines
the <code>.=</code> with the <code>some</code> match. Using this, the
<code>isMarriedTo</code> function becomes:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">isMarriedTo(P,J) where JJ^=P.spouse =&gt; J==JJ.
isMarriedTo(_,_) default =&gt; false.
</pre></div>
<p>The meaning of <code>^=</code> is similar to the pattern match condition
<code>.=</code>; except that the pattern is assumed to be for a <code>some</code>
value.
</p>
<p>While the <code>^=</code> operator<a name="DOCF21" href="#FOOT21"><sup>21</sup></a> is very
useful in unpacking an optional value, the <code>^|</code> operator allows
us to handle cases where we always need to be able to give some kind
of value. For example, normally a <code>map</code> returns none if an entry
is not present. However, a <em>cache</em> is structured differently: if
a value is not present in a cache then we must go fetch it:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">cacheValue(K) =&gt; cache[K] ^| fetch(K)
</pre></div>

<p>We can also apply a match <em>in line</em> to an <code>option</code>al value. The
<code>^</code> operator allows a pattern to be formed by applying a
<code>option</code> valued function directly in place. For example, the
equation:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">head(first^(1)) =&gt; &quot;alpha&quot;
</pre></div>
<p>is equivalent to:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">head(X) where some(1).=first(X) =&gt; &quot;alpha&quot;
</pre></div>
<p>We will see more examples of this when we look more closely at
sequences and collections processing.
</p>
<p>Finally, we can promote an optional expression into an enclosing
expression (which is therefore also optional). For example, in the
expression:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">nameOf(^P.spouse)
</pre></div>
<p>if <code>P.spouse</code> is <code>none</code>, then the value returned by the
<code>nameOf</code> expression is also <code>none</code>, otherwise it takes the
form:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">some(&quot;P_spouse_name&quot;)
</pre></div>
<p>(assuming that <code>nameOf</code> is defined for <code>Person</code>s.)
</p>
<p>Overall, the <code>option</code> type is part of an elegant approach to
nullability that is easily incorporated into <strong>Star</strong>&rsquo;s (and similar)
type system.

<h3 class="section">3.7 A word about type inference</h3>
<p>We have seen some powerful forms of types in this chapter: recursive
types defined using algebraic type definitions, generic types and even
function types. Recall also that <strong>Star</strong> only requires programmers to
explicitly declare the types of quantified variables and functions. It
is worth pausing a little to see how this might be done.
</p>
<p>Recall our original <code>fact</code> function:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">fact(0) =&gt; 1.
fact(N) =&gt; N*fact(N-1).
</pre></div>
<p>The compiler is able to compute the types of the various variables
automatically through a process known as <em>type inference</em>. Type
inference may seem magical, but is actually (mostly) quite simple. Let
us take a look at the expression:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">N-1
</pre></div>
<p>which is buried within the recursive call in <code>fact</code>. Although it
looks like a special operator, <strong>Star</strong> does not treat arithmetic
expressions in a special way; the <code>-</code> function is just a function
from numbers to numbers; its type is given by:<a name="DOCF22" href="#FOOT22"><sup>22</sup></a>
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">(-) : all t ~~ arith[t] |: (t,t)=&gt;t
</pre></div>
<p>However, we should simplify this type a little in order to make the
explanation of type inference a little simpler. In what follows, we
assume that the type of (<code>-</code>) is:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">(-) : (integer,integer)=&gt;integer
</pre></div>
<p>Type inference proceeds by using special <em>type inference rules</em>
which relate expressions to types, in this case the applicable rule is
that a function application is consistent if the function&rsquo;s parameter
types are consistent with the types of the actual arguments. If they
are consistent, then the type of the function application is the
return type of the function.
</p>
<p>The type inference process initially gives every variable an unknown
type &ndash; represented by a new type variable not appearing anywhere
else. For our tiny <code>N-1</code> example, we will give <code>N</code> the type
<var>t<sub>N</sub></var>.
</p>
<p>The (<code>-</code>) function has two arguments whose types can be expressed
as a tuple of types:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">(integer,integer)
</pre></div>
<p>and the types of the actual arguments are also a tuple:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">(<var>t<sub>N</sub></var>,integer)
</pre></div>
<p>In order for the expression to be type correct, the actual types of
the arguments must be consistent with the expected types of the
function; which we can do by making them <em>the same</em>. There is a
particular process used to do this &ndash; called <em>unification</em>.
</p>
<div class="float"><a name="minusTypeFig"></a>

<img src="images/minustype.png" alt="images/minustype">
<div class="float-caption"><p><strong>Figure 3.2: </strong>Inferring the Type of N-1</p></div></div>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><em>Unification</em></dt>
<dd><p>An algorithm that replaces variables with values in such a way as to
make two terms identical.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Unification matches equals with equals and handles (type) variables by
substitutions &ndash; for example, we can make these two type expressions
equal by <em>binding</em> the type variable <var>t<sub>N</sub></var> to
<code>integer</code>.
</p>
<p>We initially picked the type of <code>N</code> to be an arbitrary type
variable, but the process of checking consistency leads us to refine
this and make the type concrete. I.e., the use of <code>N</code> in a
context where an integer is expected is enough to allow the compiler
to infer that the type of <code>N</code> is indeed <code>integer</code> and not
<var>t<sub>N</sub></var>.
</p>
<p>Of course, if there are multiple occurrences of <code>N</code> then each of
those occurrences must also be consistent with integer; and if an
occurrence is not consistent then the compiler will report an error &ndash;
a given expression may only have one type!
</p>
<p>The bottom line is that <strong>Star</strong>&rsquo;s types are based on a combination of
unification for comparing types and a series of type rules that have
the effect of introducing <em>constraints</em> on types based on which
language features are present in the text. The type checker is really
a constraint solver: if the constraints are not satisfiable (for
example by trying to &lsquo;call&rsquo; a variable and add a number to it) then
there is a type error in the program.
</p>
<p>The magic of type inference arises because it turns out that solving
these constraints is sufficient for robustly type checking programs.
</p>
<p>A sharp-eyed reader will notice that <strong>Star</strong>&rsquo;s type system is
different in nature to that found (say) in OO languages. In <strong>Star</strong>&rsquo;s
type system, types are considered to be consistent in <strong>Star</strong> if they
are <em>equal</em>. This is quite different to the notion of consistency
in OO languages where an argument to a function is consistent if its
type is a <em>sub-type</em> of the expected type.
</p>
<p>However, we would note that the apparent restriction to the type
system imposed by type equality is much less severe in practice than
in theory &ndash; and that OO languages&rsquo; type systems also often
incorporate some of the same restrictions.

<p>We have stated a few times that <strong>Star</strong>&rsquo;s type system only infers
types of variables that are <em>not</em> quantified. In fact, it is fairly
simple to build a type inference system that can infer quantified
types. For example, such a complete type inference system would infer
from these equations:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">conc(nil,x)=&gt;x.
conc(cons(h,tl),x) =&gt; cons(h,conc(tl,x))
</pre></div>
<p>the generalized type for <code>conc</code>:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">conc:all t ~~ (cons[t],cons[t])=&gt;cons[t].
</pre></div>
<p>However, several technical and non-technical considerations stay our hand at building such a type inference system:
</p>
<ul>
<li> There are still types that cannot be correctly inferred; and would
therefore require explicit type annotations to correctly type the
program.
</li><li> Having explicit type annotations is &rsquo;good style&rsquo; in general and
definitely aids in debugging type errors.
</li></ul>

<p>On the other hand, requiring type annotations for <em>every</em> variable is
extremely tedious and verbose. An extreme version of this policy would
require the <code>conc</code> program above to be written:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">conc:all t ~~ (cons[t],cons[t])=&gt;cons[t].
conc(nil,x:list[t])=&gt;x.
conc(cons(h:t,tl:list[t]),x:list[t]) =&gt; cons(h,conc(t,x))
</pre></div>
<p>The design of <strong>Star</strong> strikes a balance between useability and rigor:
most variables do not require explicit type annotations. We require
them only when something &rsquo;special&rsquo; is being indicated; one of those
special circumstances is when defining a generic function.
</p>
<p>Even there, there are many situations where explicit type annotations
are not needed: for example when defining a field in a record, or a
function in the implementation of a contract, there already is a type
that the type system can use to verify the program.
</p>
<p>So, the precise rule for type inference is:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the type of a variable is known from context, then use that type to
verify the type of any value the variable may be bound to. Otherwise,
use type inference on the value to infer a type for the variable but
do not attempt to generalize it by adding quantifiers to the inferred
type.
</p></blockquote>

<p>We are only able to scratch the surface of the type system here. It is
certainly true that &ndash; like many modern functional languages &ndash;
<strong>Star</strong>&rsquo;s type system is complex and subtle. The primary motivation
for this complexity is to reduce the burden for the programmer: by
being able to infer types automatically, and by being able to address
many programming subtleties, the type system comes to be seen as the
programmer&rsquo;s friend rather than as an obstacle to be &lsquo;gotten around&rsquo;.

<h3 class="section">3.8 Are we there yet?</h3>

<p>The straightforward answer to this is no. There is a great deal more
to functional programming than can be captured in a few
pages. However, we have covered some of the key features of functional
programming &ndash; particularly as it applies to <strong>Star</strong>. In subsequent
chapters we will take a closer look at collections, at modular
programming, at concurrency and even take a pot shot at Monads.
</p>
<p>If there is a single idea to take away from this chapter it should be
that functional programming is natural. If there is a single piece of
advice for the budding functional <strong>Star</strong> programmer, it should be to
<em>hide the recursion</em>. If there is a single bit of comfort to
offer programmers it should be that <em>Rome was not built in a
day</em>.
</p>
<p>In the next chapter we look at collections, one of the richest topics
in programming.
