= Concepts and Ontologies
(((ontology)))

Star offers a standard suite of features that permit applications
to parse _ontology_ files using a variant of the N3 standard for
describing triple-based ontologies.

== RDF and N3
RDF is a W3C standard for specifying simple ontologies using a very
simple language: an RDF graph is a set of _triples_; each triple
consists of a subject, a predicate and an object -- all of which are
_concepts_. In the standard notation, RDF triples are written
using an XML-based notation; however, there is a more convenient
notation often used called `N3`.

[#tripleFig]
.N3 Triples
[source,star]
----
triple --> subject predicate object.

subject --> identifiedConcept.
predicate --> identifiedConcept.
object --> concept.
----

where _Subject_, _Predicate_ and _Object_ are all
concepts. Such a statement is called a _Triple_. N3 supports
several shortened forms of triples; for example, a statement such as:

[source,star]
----
person:john family:parent-of person:jim, person:jane.
----

is equivalent to two triples:
[source,star]
----
person:john family:parent-of person:jim.
person:john family:parent-of person:jim.
----

and:
[source,star]
----
person:john family:parent-of person:jim;
            dc:has-name "john".
----
            
is equivalent to:
[source,star]
----
person:john family:parent-of person:jim.
person:john dc:has-name "john".
----

The comma allows the same subject and predicate to refer to multiple
objects and the semi-colon allows the same subject to have multiple
predicate/objects associated with it.

== Interpretation Layers

There are four interpretation layers of concepts appearing in an
ontology: concepts, triples, classes and application.

=== RDF Concepts

Concepts in RDF are identifiers that signify a concept of interest to
the ontology modeler. There are two main kinds of concept:
<<identifiedConcept>>s and literals. An identified concept
gains its meaning solely from the sentences in which it occurs;
typically that means its role as subject, predicate or object in one
more sentences.

Generally, identified concepts have no intrinsic meaning outside the graph.

Literals, on the other hand, do not generally particate as a linking
element across sentences: their meaning depends on external
interpretations. As such, literal concepts may only be objects of
sentences: never subjects nor predicates.

NOTE:  The one exception to this is string text. String text may reference
concepts using a special interpolation notation (see below).

[#conceptFig]
.N3 Concepts
[source,star]
----
concept --> identifiedConcept.
concept --> ["<"], uri, [">"].
concept --> text.
concept --> decimal.
----

[#identifiedConcept]
==== Identified Concept

An identified concept is one that is given a name. In comparison with other
kinds of concepts -- uri, text and decimal -- the only way of interpreting an
identified concept is in its relationship to other concepts.

.Identified Concept
[source,star]
----
identifiedConcept --> prefix, [":"], name.

prefix --> name * [":"].

name --> identifier.
----

Identified concpets are ubiquitous in any sized RDF graph: they form the
backbone of the graph structure.

[#uriConcept]
==== URI Concept

A uri concept is a uri. Uri concepts serve two roles in typical RDF graphs: they
identify an entity that is outside the graph; such as a Web page or an external
resource.

Uri concepts are also sometimes used when a more precise meaning is attached to the concept -- again, typically outside the graph.

[#textConcept]
==== Text Concept

Syntactically, a text concept is simply a string. As a concept, text concepts
'stand for themselves': i.e., there is no intended relationship with any other
concept.

In practice, text concepts are used as a way of communicating with human users:
they are sometimes used, for example, to give human-readable names of concepts.

Another use for text concepts is as 'bulk text' that can be used as part of a
graph application.
