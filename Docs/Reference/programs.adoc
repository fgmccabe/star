[[programs]]

This chapter focuses on the organization of programs using functions, procedures and other computational forms. Apart from program values themselves, a key concept is the <<thetaEnvironment>>. This is where many programs, types etc. are defined. <<thetaEnvironment>>s are also first-class values -- showing up as <<AnonymousRecord>>s.


[[thetaEnvironment]]
== Theta Environment
(((theta environment)))
(((program declaration)))

A <<thetaEnvironment>> consists of a set of definitions of types, programs and variables.

[[statementFig]]

[[Definition]]Definition ::= <<TypeDefinition>>

Many of the definitions in a <<thetaEnvironment>> define entities that may be recursive and mutually recursive.

(((type,definition)))
[horizontal]
Type definition:: is the definition of a type. See <<typeDefinitions>>
(((type,declaration)))
Type declaration:: is a statement that defines the type of a variable or program. See <<typeAnnotation>>
(((variable,definition)))
Variable definition:: is a statement that defines a variable and gives it a value. There are two forms of variable definition corresponding to a normal single assignment variable and a re-assignable variable. See <<VariableDeclaration>>
Function definition::
(((function,definition)))is a group of equations that defines a function. See <<equations>>.
Procedure definition::
(((procedure,definition))) is a statement that defines an action procedure. See <<procedures>>.
LocalAction::
(((actions,in a theta environment)))A <<LocalAction>> is an action -- enclosed in braces -- that is performed prior to the bound expression of a <<thetaEnvironment>>.
Contract definition::
(((contract,definition)))is a statement that defines a coherent collection of functions and procedures that may be associated with different types. See <<ContractDefinition>>.
Contract implementation::
(((contract,implementation)))
is a statement that establishes that a particular type _implements_ a contract -- and gives the implementation. See <<ContractImplementation>>.
Macro definition::
(((macro,definition)))is a statement that indicates how source programs should be interpreted. See <<MacroLanguage>>. Macro statements may only appear at the `package`-level: they are not permitted within the body of a `let` expression, for example.


[[functions]]
== Functions and Equations

A function is a program for computing values; organized as a set of equations.

[[functionFig]]
.Functions
****
[[Function]]Function ::= <<Equation>> ... <<Equation>>

[[Equation]]Equation ::= <<RuleHead>> [<<RuleGuard>>]] `\=>` <<Expression>>
&nbsp;&nbsp;| <<DefltEquation>>

[[DefltEquation]]DefltEquation ::= <<RuleHead>> `default` `\=>` <<Expression>>

[[RuleHead]]RuleHead ::= <<Identifier>>`(`<<Pattern>>,...,<<Pattern>>>`)`

[[RuleGuard]]RuleGuard ::= `default` | <<GuardCondition>>>

[[GuardCondition]]GuardCondition ::= `::` <<Condition>>
****

[TIP]
Functions and other program values are first class values; as a result they may be passed as arguments to other functions as well as being assigned as attributes of records.

[FunctionType]
=== Function Type
The function type takes the form:

****
__TupleType__ \=> _Type_
****

where <<TupleType>> is a type denoting a tuple of values.

Functions can be defined in a <<thetaEnvironment>> -- which case they must be associated with an explicit or implicit <<TypeAnnotation>> -- or they may be _anonymous_ -- i.e., appear as a function literal in an expression.

[[equations]]
=== Equations
An equation is a rule for deciding how to rewrite an expression into a simpler expression. Each equation consists of a <<TuplePattern>> that is used to match the call to the function and a replacement expression. The left hand side of the function may also have a guard associated with it, this guard may use variables introduced in the pattern.

[TIP]
An equation is said to apply iff the patterns in the left hand side of the equation (including any `::` clauses) all match the corresponding actual arguments to the function application.


(((theta environment)))
Functions are defined in the context of a <<thetaEnvironment>> -- for example, in the body of a `let` expression (see <<letExpression>>), or at the top-level of a `package`.

It is not necessary for the equations that define a function to be contiguous within a <<thetaEnvironment>>. However, all the equations for a function must be present in the _same_ <<thetaEnvironment>>.

[TIP]
The equations that define a function must be contiguous. This helps to avoid a certain kind of error where equations seem to `go missing' but are just misplaced.

==== Type Safety
The type safety of a function is addressed in stages. In the first place, we give the rules for individual equations:

****
_E_ |= ``A``:AT /\ _E'_ |= ``R``:RT => _E_ |= `A\=>R` : AT\=>RT
****

If the equation has a <<GuardCondition>>, that that condition must be type satisfiable:

****
_E_ |= A:AT /\ _E'_ |= sat\(C) /\ _E''_ |= R:RT => _E_ |= A::C => R : AT\=>RT
****

where _E'_ is the original environment _E_ extended with the variable definitions found in the pattern `A` and _E''_ is _E'_ extended with the variables found in the condition `C`.

In fact this rule slightly understates the type safety requirement. For any statement in a theta environment we also have:

****
F:T &in; E &iff; E|=F:T
****

I.e, top-level definitions _must_ have a type annotation associated with them; and that actual definitions _must_ be consistent with those annotations.

=== Evaluation Order of Equations
[[functionEvaluation]]
(((equations,evaluation order)))

Using multiple equations to define a function permits a case-base approach to function design -- each equation relates to a single case in the function. When such a function is _applied_ to actual arguments then only one of the equations in the definition may apply.

Equations are applied in the order that they are written -- apart from any equation that is marked `default`. If two equations overlap in their patterns then the first equation to apply is the one used.

=== Default Equations
[[defaultEquation]]
(((default equation@`default` equation)))
(((functions,default@`default` equation)))

It is permitted to assign one of the equations in a function definition to be the `default` equation. An equation marked as `default` is guaranteed _not_ to be used if any of the non-default equations apply. Thus, a `default` equation may be used to capture any remaining cases not covered by other equations.

(((patterns,variable pattern)))A `default` equation may not have a where clause associated with it, and furthermore, the patterns in the left hand-side should be generally be variable patterns (see <<patternVariables>>).

[TIP]
In particular, it _should_ be guaranteed that a `default` equation cannot fail to apply.


=== Evaluation Order of Arguments
(((function application,evaluation order)))

There is _no_ guarantee as to the order of evaluation of arguments to a function application. In fact, there is no guarantee that a given expression will, in fact, be evaluated.

[TIP]
The programmer should also _not_ assume that argument expressions will _not_ be evaluated!

In general, the programmer should make the fewest possible assumptions about order of evaluation.

=== Pattern Coverage
[[patternCoverage]]
(((patterns,coverage of)))

Any given equation in a function definition need not completely cover the possible arguments to the function. For example, in
[listing]
F : (integer)=>integer;
F(0) => 1
F(X) => X*F(X-1)

the first equation only applies if the actual argument is the number `0`; which is certainly not all the `integer`s.

The set of equations that define a function also define a coverage of the potential values of the actual arguments. In general, the coverage of a set of equations is smaller than the possible values as determined by the type of the function.

If a function is _partial_ -- i.e., if the coverage implied by the patterns of the function's equations is not complete with respect to the types -- then the compiler may issue an incomplete coverage warning.

[TIP]
The programmer is advised to make functions _total_ by supplying an appropriate `default` equation. In the case of the `F`actorial function above, we can make the `default` case explicit as is shown in <<factorialFun>>.


[[factorialFun]]
.Factorial Function
[listing]
fact : (integer)=>integer
fact(X) :: X>0 => X*fact(X-1)
fact(X) default => 1

[[anonymousFunction]]
=== Anonymous Function
(((anonymous function)))
(((expressions,function)))

Anonymous functions are expressions of the form:
[listing]
(X) => X+Y

Anonymous functions may appear anywhere a function value is permitted.


[[anonymousFunctionFig]]
.Anonymous Function
****
[[AnonymousFunction]]AnonymousFunction ::= <<TuplePattern>> `\=>` <<Expression>>
****

[TIP]
====
If it desired to have a single-argument anonymous function that takes a tuple pattern then use double parentheses:
[listing]
((X,Y)) => X+Y
====

For example, an anonymous function to add 1 to its single argument would be:
[listing]
(X) => X+1

Anonymous functions are often used in function-valued functions. For example in:
[listing]
addX:(integer)=>((integer)=>integer);
addX(X) => ((Y) => X+Y)

the value returned by `addX` is another function -- a single argument function that adds a fixed number to its argument.

[NOTE]
Note the extra set of parentheses around both the embedded function type and around the returned function value.

[NOTE]
Anonymous functions may reference free variables.


==== Type Safety
The type of an anonymous function is determined by the types of the argument patterns and the return type. Unlike named functions, anonymous functions are not explicitly typed.

****
_E_ |= ``A``:AT /\ _E_ |= ``R``:RT => _E_ |= `A\=>R` : AT\=>RT
****

=== Overloaded Functions
[[overloadedFunctions]]
The type of an overloaded function has a characteristic signature: it's type is universally quantified but with a constraint on the bound type variables.

For example, given the definition:
[listing]
dble:all t ~~ arithmetic[t] |: (t)=>t
dble(X) => X+X

the generalized type assigned to the `dble` variable is:
[listing]
all t ~~ arithmetic[t] |: (t)=>t

As noted in <<overloading>>, the `dble` function is converted to a function with an explicit dictionary argument that carries the implementation of the `arithmetic` contract:
[listing]
dble:all t ~~ (arithmetic[t])$=>(t)=>t
dble(A) => let{
  dble_:(t)=>t
  dble_(X) => (A.+)(X,X)
} in dble_

In effect, this means that the `dble` has _two_ types assigned to it: the constrained type above that is inferred through type inference and an overloaded type that results from its translation.
[listing]
all t ~~ (arithmetic[t])$=>(t)=>t

[NOTE]
Overloaded types are function types, but we use a different types symbol -- `$\=>` -- to help distinguish the special role that overloaded types have.

[TIP]
The existence of an overloaded type associated with a variable is an important signal: it means that references to the variable must be resolved -- that appropriate `implementation`s of the required contracts are found.

When an overloaded function variable is referenced the normal type of the variable expression is identical to the normal rule for variable expressions: the type of the expression is the refreshed type of the constrained type associated with the variable.

However, the existence of the overloaded type associated with the variable acts as a signal that the overloading must be resolved.

For example, in the function:
[listing]
quad:all t ~~ arithmetic[t] |: (t)=>t
quad(X) => dble(dble(X))

the type of each `dble` variable expression is determined to be:
[listing]
arithmetic[t] |: (t)=>t

[NOTE]
They are the same type in this case because of the calling pattern for `dble`.

Since `dble` originally had a constrained type -- together with its associated overloaded type -- both references must be resolved by supplying an implementation of `arithmetic`. I.e., both `dble` expressions are interpreted as:
[listing]
dble[A](dble[A](X))

where we use `dble[A]` as a special form function call footnote:[We use this notation for exposition purposes only -- it is not normal `*Star* syntax'.] that denotes a use of the overloaded function.

The `quad` function is generic, and so its type is also a generalized constrained type:
[listing]
quad:all t ~~ arithmetic[t] |: (t)=>t

and is also transformed into the overloaded definition:
[listing]
quad:all t ~~ (arithmetic[t]) $=> (t)=>t
quad(A) => let{
  quad_:(t)=>t
  quad_(X) => dble[A](dble[A](X))
} in quad_

In effect, the resolved dictionary for `arithmetic` is `pulled out' to a larger scope.

In all cases, for overloaded functions to be invoked correctly, there must be some outermost point where an overloaded function is invoked with a concrete implementation value.

If an overloaded variable is not properly resolved, then the compiler will issue a syntax error.

In most cases, the outermost scope of a program is package-level. It is possible for a package to export an overloaded function -- in which case imports of the package must resolve the overloaded function.

=== Open Statement
[[openStatement]]
(((open statement)))
(((opening a record)))
(((record,opening)))

The <<OpenStatement>> takes a <<Record>>-valued expression and `opens its contents' in a <<thetaEnvironment>>. It is analogous to an <<Import>> of the record.

[[openStatementFig]]
.Open Statement
****
[[OpenStatement]]OpenStatement ::= `open` <<Expression>>
****


Any fields and types that are declared within the <<Expression>>'s type become defined within the enclosing <<thetaEnvironment>>.
[TIP]
The existing scope rules continue to apply; in particular, if there is a name that is duplicated already in scope then a duplicate definition error will be signaled.

[TIP]
Normal type inference is not able to infer anything about the type of the ``open``ed <<Expression>>. Hence, this statement requires that the type of the expression is already known.

For example, given the definition:
[listing]
R : { type elem; op:(elem,elem)=>elem; zero:elem}
R = {
  type integer counts as elem
  op(X,Y) => X+Y
  zero = 0
}

then we can `open` `R` in a <<LetExpression>>:
[listing]
let{
  open R
  Z : elem
  Z = zero
} in Z

[TIP]
====
Although the `open` statement makes available the types and fields embedded in a record; existential abstraction still applies. In particular, in this case the fact that the `elem` type is manifest as `integer` within the record expression `R` is hidden.

The `elem` type (and the `zero` and `op` fields) are available within the `let`; but no information about what `elem` actually is is available.
====

[[localAction]]
=== Local Actions
(((Actions executed within a <<thetaEnvironment>>)))

A local action is a sequence of actions -- enclosed in braces -- that are performed when the theta environment is first entered and before any dependent bound expressions are evaluated.

For example, in:
[listing]
traceF : (integer)=>integer
traceF(X) =>
  let{
    f:(integer)=>integer
    f(0) => 1
    f(XX) => XX*f(XX-1)
    {
      logMsg(info,"in theta environment");
    }
  } in f(X)

The action
[listing]
logMsg(info,"in theta environment")

is executed as part of establishing the <<thetaEnvironment>> prior to the function `f` being evaluated.

Local actions are useful for situations where proper initialization of the entries in the theta environment are more extensive than binding a variable to a value.

[TIP]
There is no predetermined order of execution of <<LocalAction>>s -- for example, if there is more than one in a given <<thetaEnvironment>>. The compiler ensures that all the preconditions for the <<LocalAction>> -- specifically definitions that are referenced by the <<LocalAction>> -- are established prior to the execution of the action.

[[procedures]]
== Procedures

An action procedure is an action script -- a program for performing actions. Analogously to functions and other rule types, procedures are written as a set of action rules.

[[procedureSyntaxFig]]
.Procedures and Action Rules
****
[[Procedure]]Procedure ::=  <<ActionRule>> ... <<ActionRule>>

[[ActionRule]]ActionRule::= <<RuleHead>> [<<RuleGuard>>]] `do` <<Action>>
****

Action rules are analogous to the use of equations for defining functions; except that an action is being specified.

The equivalent of `Hello World' as a procedure would be:
[listing]
hello:()=>()
hello() do logMsg(info,"Hello World")

The left hand side of an action rule may contain patterns other than variables, it may also include _guard_ conditions:
[listing]
displaySigned:(integer) => ()
displaySigned(X) :: X>0 do logMsg(info,"$X is positive")
displaySigned(X) default do logMsg(info,"$X is not positive")

[NOTE]
The type of a procedure looks like a function type -- where the return type is the empty tuple. This is because that is what procedures are: functions that do not return a value.

==== Type Safety

A procedure is type safe if the action(s) in the body are type safe -- in the environment augmented by the variables in the head of the procedure.

****
_E_ |= ``A``:AT /\ E' |= safeAction(XX) => E |= `A do XX` : AT\=>()
****

If the action rule has a <<GuardCondition>>, that that condition must be type satisfiable:

****
_E_ |= A:AT /\ _E'_ |= sat\(C) /\ _E''_ |= safeAction(XX) => _E_ |= A::C do XX : AT\=>()
****


=== Anonymous Procedure
[[anonymousAction]]
(((anonymous action procedure)))
(((expressions,procedure)))

A procedure is a "first class value" and can be assigned to variables, passed in functions and so on. In addition, a procedure may be expressed as a _literal expression_ in the form of an _anonymous procedure_ expression. An anonymous action procedure consists of an action procedure -- using `procedure` as the `name' of the procedure.


[[anonymousProcedureFig]]
.Anonymous Action Procedure
****
[[AnonProcedure]]AnonProcedure ::= <<TuplePattern>> `do` <<Action>>
****

For example, to use the tree walk as defined in <<treeWalkProg>> to display all the leaf nodes, we pass in to `walk` an anonymous procedure to display the leaf:
[listing]
walk(Tr,((X) do logMsg(info,"$X")))

Anonymous procedures may access free variables; but may not be directly recursive (see <<anonymousFunction>>).


[[tauPattern]]
== Pattern Abstractions
A *pattern abstraction* allows patterns to be treated as first class values; in an analogous way that lambda abstractions allow expressions to be processed.
(((pattern abstractions)))


[[tauPtnFig]]
.Pattern Abstraction Definitions
****
_Expression_ ::+= <<AnonymousPattern>>

[[AnonymousPattern]]AnonymousPattern ::= <<TupleLiteral>>` \<= ` <<Pattern>>

[[PatternAbstraction]]PatternAbstraction ::=  <<PatternRule>> ... <<PatternRule>>

[[PatternRule]]PatternRule::=<<Identifier>>``(``<<Expression>> ,..., <<Expression>>``) \<=`` <<Pattern>>
****

A pattern of the form
[listing]
$_Ab_$($_Ptn\sub1_\sequence{,}_Ptn_$)

represents an application of the pattern abstraction `_Ab_`; i.e., the pattern matches if the abstracted pattern within the definition `_Ab_` matches _and_ that `_Ptn\subi_` match the `returned' values from the pattern.

For example, the definition:
[listing]
TM(X) <= ("fred",X)

defines `TM` as a pattern that will match binary tuples -- of which the first element is the string `"fred"` and returns the second element of the tuple.

We can use `TM` to match such tuples, as in:
[listing]
for TM(Y) in R do
  ...

assuming that the type of `R` was appropriately a `list` of 2-tuples.

The application argument of a pattern abstraction is also a pattern; so we can look for special forms of `TM` patterns in `R`:
[listing]
if TM(3) in R then
  ...

The pattern application `TM(3)` is equivalent to the pattern
[listing]
("fred",3)

<<filterProg>> is a more elaborate example that uses a pattern abstraction to filter elements of a `list`, removing elements that are less than zero.
(((filtering elements of a `list` with pattern abstractions)))
(((list,filtering with pattern abstractions)))
(((pattern abstractions,using to filtering lists)))

[listing]

==== Type Safety
The type of a pattern abstraction is determined by the type of pattern matched by the abstraction:
****
E |= P:PT /\ E' |= XX:XT ⇒ E |= XX \<= P  : XT\<=PT
****
