An action is the performance of an operation in a particular context.

==== Actions and Type Safety
[[actionTypeSafety]]
The meaning of type safety is somewhat different for actions than for expressions and functions: by definition, actions do not denote values in the way that expressions do.

However, type safety still applies to actions. In particular, different actions have different _type constraints_ that must be satisfied; for example, an assignment action is _type safe_ if the type of the variable is consistent with the expression and if the variable is a re-assignable variable.

We use the meta-predicate \safeinf{} to indicate that a particular action is type safe. An assertion of the form:
\[\typesafe{E}{A}\]
means that the action $A$ is type-consistent given the environment $E$. In fact, this predicate is equivalent to a normal type derivation involving the `()` type:
\[\typesafe{E}{A}\ \iff\ \typeprd{E}{A}{`()`}\]

== Binding Actions
Many actions are operators that change the state of one of more variables. However, some actions may bind variables -- that is, establish a new variable.

The most important binding actions are local variable definitions (<<localVar>>) and assignments (<<assignment>>).

=== Local Variable Definition
[[localVar]]
(((action,local variable)))
(((variables in actions)))

A local variable may be introduced within a block -- see <<blockAction>> -- using the same syntax as a variable declaration statement -- see <<VariableDeclaration>>.
\begin{aside}
It is named a local variable simply because it's scope is limited to the block of actions that contain the declaration.
\end{aside}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{eqnarray*}
[[LocalVariable]]LocalVariable::=`var`\ <<Identifier>>\ `:=`\ <<Expression>>\\
&nbsp;&nbsp;| `def`<<Pattern>>\ `is`\ <<Expression>>
\end{eqnarray*}
.Local Variable
[[localVariableFig]]
\end{figure}

The scope of a local variable declaration is from the local declaration itself to the end of the containing _ActionBlock_.

\begin{aside}
It is an error for a variable to be referenced within its own definition. Recursive definitions are not permitted as <<LocalVariable>>s.
\end{aside}

A local variable declared using the `var`...`:=` form is _re-assignable_; whereas a variable declared using the `def`...`is` form is not. The type of a re-assignable variable is a `ref`erence type (see <<referenceType>>). For example, given the <<LocalVariable>> declaration:
[listing]
X := 3

then the variable `X` has type `ref integer`.

If the left hand side of an `is` local variable definition is an identifier, or is an unterm, then the `var` prefix is not required. However, it is good practice to use `var` in situations that may be confusing.

\begin{aside}
Note that the left hand side of an `is` definition is a `Pattern`, not simply an `Identifier`. One primary use for this form is to allow the `unpacking' of function results. For example, the function `ddivide` returns a pair of values: the quotient and the remainder result of dividing the first argument by the second:
[listing]
ddivide(X,Y) is (X/Y,X%Y)

We can unpack the results of a call to `ddivide` using a <<TuplePattern>> on the left hand side of the declaration:
[listing]
def (Q,R) is ddivide(34,3)

which would have the effect of binding `Q` to 11, and `R` to 1.
\begin{aside}
The reason that we get `integer` division with this call to `ddivide` is that the arguments to `ddivide` -- `34` and `3` -- are `integer`. The slightly different call:
[listing]
def (FQ,FR) is ddivide(34.0,3.0)

relies on `float`int point `arithmetic` and results in binding `FQ` to 11.333333, and `FR` to 1.0.
\end{aside}
\end{aside}

\begin{aside}
Local variables may be reassigned by an assignment action anywhere _in the same_ block as the variable declaration itself. For example, the following, somewhat complex, scenario:
[listing]
valof\{
  var X := 0;
  def inc is (() do { X:=X+1; })
  valis X
\}

the assignment to `X` within the `inc` procedure is permitted; even though it  side-effect a variable not defined directly within the procedure.
\end{aside}

==== Declaring Variables
(((variable,declaration)))
The type of a <<Variable>> can be declared in an action sequence using a <<TypeAnnotation>> statement prior to the declaration itself:
[listing]
X has type ref integer;
var X := 3


==== Type Safety
A variable declaration is type safe if the type of the variable is the same as the type of the expression giving its value.
\begin{aside}
Of course, it is often the case that the type of a variable is determined from its declaration; so type safety is typically more an issue for other references to the variable identifier than for the variable declaration itself.
\end{aside}

\BinaryInfC{\typesafe{E}{`var`\ V\ `:=`\ Ex}}
\end{prooftree}

=== Assignment
[[assignment]]
(((action,assignment)))
(((assignment)))
The assignment action `:=` replaces the contents of a variable with a new value. For example:
[listing]
Count := Count+3

changes the value associated with the variable `Count` to `Count+3` -- where `Count+3` refers to the `old' value of `Count`.

There are a number of variations on the basic form of assignment; it is possible to `replace' an element of a `list` or an attribute of a record. However, semantically, all the different syntactic forms of assignment have a common root: that of changing a variable to have a different value.

Figures~\vref{assignmentFig}, \vref{recordTargetFig}, and \vref{IndexTargetFig} show the different syntactic forms of an assignment action.

\begin{aside}
Assignment is restricted to replacing the value of a `ref`erence typed variable or record field.
\end{aside}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{eqnarray*}
[[Assignment]]Assignment::=<<VariableAssignment>>\\
&nbsp;&nbsp;| <<IndexedAssignment>>\\
&nbsp;&nbsp;| <<RecordAssignment>>\\
[[VariableAssignment]]VariableAssignment::=<<Variable>>\ `:=`\ <<Expression>>
\end{eqnarray*}
.Assignment Action
[[assignmentFig]]
\end{figure}

==== Type Safety
A variable assignment is safe iff the type of the variable is a `ref`erence type that is consistent with the expression denoting the variable's new value.

\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{\typeprd{E}{V}{`ref`\ T}}
\AxiomC{\typeprd{E}{Vl}{T}}
\BinaryInfC{\typesafe{E}{V` := `Vl}}
\end{prooftree}

=== Updating Records
[[recordUpdate]]
(((record values,update)))
(((update record values)))
An individual field of a record may be updated using the dot-notation on the left hand side of an assignment action -- provided that the type of the field is a `ref` type. In effect, assignment to a record field is permitted only if the field was marked as being updateable.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{eqnarray*}
[[RecordAssignment]]RecordAssignment::=<<Expression>>`.`<<Identifier>> `:=`\ <<Expression>>\\
\end{eqnarray*}
.Record Assignment[[recordTargetFig]]
\end{figure}


==== Type Safety
For a record update to be type safe, the field being updated must have `ref`erence type.

\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{\typeprd{E}{R}{T\sub{R}\ `where `T\sub{R}` implements \{`N` has type ref `T\sub{N}`\`}}}
\AxiomC{\typeprd{E}{V}{T\sub{N}}}
\BinaryInfC{\typesafe{E}{R`.`N\ `:=`\ V}}
\end{prooftree}
\begin{aside}
It is _not_ necessary for a variable holding the record to be itself re-assignable.
\end{aside}

=== Updating Indexable Collections
[[sequenceUpdate]]
(((sequences,update)))
(((update sequences)))
An `indexable` sequence may be updated using the square index notation on the on the left hand side of an assignment action.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{eqnarray*}
[[IndexedAssignment]IndexedAssignment::=<<Expression>>`[`<<Expression>>`]]``:=`\ <<Expression>>\\
&nbsp;&nbsp;| `remove`\ <<Expression>>`[`<<Expression>>`]`
\end{eqnarray*}
.Index Assignment[[IndexTargetFig]]
\end{figure}

An assignment of the form:
[listing]
A[ix] := 34

is syntactic short-hand for
[listing]
A := A[with ix->34]

which, in turn, is shorthand for:
[listing]
A := _set_indexed(A,ix,34)


An assignment of the form:
[listing]
remove C[ix]

means to delete the identified element of the collection and is syntactic shorthand for the assignment:
[listing]
A := A[without ix]

which, in turn, is shorthand for:
[listing]
A := _delete_indexed(A,ix)


\begin{aside}
As noted in <<indexableContract>>, the sequence assignment is not restricted to sequences with `integer` indices. The same assignment statement also applies to `dictionary` updates.
\end{aside}

==== Type Safety
For an indexable update to be type safe, the left hand side of the assignment must refer to a variable with a `ref`erence type -- see <<referenceType>> -- and whose type implements the `indexable` contract -- see Program~\vref{indexableContractDef}.

\begin{prooftree}
\def\defaultHypSeparation{}
\AxiomC{\typeprd{E}{s}{`ref`\ S`where indexable over`\ S\ `determines`\ `(`K`,`V`)`}}
\AxiomC{\typeprd{E}{k}{K}}
\AxiomC{\typeprd{E}{v}{V}}
\TrinaryInfC{\typesafe{E}{s`[`k`]`\ `:=`\ v}}
\end{prooftree}


== Control Flow Actions
[[controlFlow]]

=== Action Block
[[blockAction]]
(((action,block)))
(((block action)))
An action block simply consists of a sequence of actions, separated by semicolons and enclosed within the pair of keywords `\{` and `\`}.

The actions in an action block are executed in sequence.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{eqnarray*}
[[ActionBlock]]ActionBlock::=`\{`\ <<Action>>\ `;`...`;` <<Action>>\ `\`}
\end{eqnarray*}
.Action Block
[[blockActionFig]]
\end{figure}

==== Scope
An <<ActionBlock>> represents a <<Scope>>. Any <<LocalVariable>>s that are defined within an <<ActionBlock>> are not defined outside the <<ActionBlock>>.

==== Type Safety
An action block is type safe if each of the actions within it are type safe.

\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{\typesafe{E}{A\sub1}}
\AxiomC{...}
\AxiomC{\typesafe{E}{A\subn}}
\TrinaryInfC{\typesafe{E}{`\{ `A\sub1;...;A\subn` \`}}}
\end{prooftree}

=== Null Action
[[nullAction]]
(((nothing@`nothing`)))

The `nothing` action does nothing. It is type safe by default.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{eqnarray*}
[[NullAction]]NullAction::=`nothing`\ |\ `\{\`}
\end{eqnarray*}
.Null Action
[[nullActionFig]]
\end{figure}

=== Let Action
[[letActionion]]
(((actions,let action@`let` action)))
(((let action@`let` action)))

A `let` action allows an action to be defined in terms of  auxiliary definitions.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{eqnarray*}
[[LetAction]]LetAction::=`let`\ <<thetaEnvironment>>\ `in`\ <<Action>>\\
&nbsp;&nbsp;| <<Action>>\ `using`\ <<thetaEnvironment>>\\
\end{eqnarray*}
.Let Action
[[letActionFig]]
\end{figure}

(((theta environment)))
A `let` action (or its cousin the `using` action) consists of an action that is performed in the enhanced context of a set of auxiliary definition. It is directly analogous to the <<LetExpression>>.


==== Type Safety
The primary safety requirement for a `let` action is that the statements that are defined within the body are type consistent. This is the same requirement for any theta environment.

=== Procedure Invocation
[[invokeProcedure]]
(((action,invoke procedure)))
(((invoke procedure action)))
A procedure invocation is the invocation of an action procedure -- effectively a sub-routine call.


\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{eqnarray*}
[[InvokeAction]]InvokeAction::=<<Expression>>`(`\ <<Expression>>\sequence{,}<<Expression>>\ `)`
\end{eqnarray*}
.Procedure Invocation
[[invokeProcedureFig]]
\end{figure}


==== Type Safety
[[procedureApplyType]]
(((type,procedure invocation)))
An action procedure invocation is type safe if the types of the arguments of the application match the argument types of the action procedure.

\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{\typeprd{E}{`P`}{t\sub{P}}}
\AxiomC{\typeprd{E}{`A`}{t\sub{A}}}
\AxiomC{\entail{E}{t\sub{P}\subsume{}t\sub{A}`=>()`}}
\TrinaryInfC{\typesafe{E}{`P A`}}
\end{prooftree}


==== Evaluation Order of Arguments
(((procedure invokation,evaluation order)))

There is _no_ guarantee as to the order of evaluation of arguments to a procedure invocation. In fact, there is no guarantee that a given expression will, in fact, be evaluated. This is similar to the situation with function application.

\begin{aside}
In order to better support parallel execution, it is quite possible that arguments to an procedure invocation are evaluated in parallel; or that their evaluation will be delayed until the value of the argument expression could make a difference to a computation.
\end{aside}

\begin{aside}
In general, the programmer should make the fewest possible assumptions about order of evaluation.
\end{aside}

=== Ignore Action
[[ignore]]
(((ignore,ignore action)))
(((ignore action)))
(((action that ignores result)))
An <<IgnoreAction>> is an action that simply ignores the value of its <<Expression>> argument.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{eqnarray*}
[[IgnoreAction]]IgnoreAction::=`ignore`\ <<Expression>>
\end{eqnarray*}
.Ignore Action[[ignoreActionFig]]
\end{figure}

==== Type Safety
An `ignore` action is type safe if its ignore expression has a type.

\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{\typeprd{E}{Ex}{Tp}}
\UnaryInfC{\typesafe{E}{`ignore`\ Ex}}
\end{prooftree}

\begin{aside}
Clearly, the purpose of `ignore` is to capture the effect of evaluating an expression. One common purpose of `ignore` is to allow a function to be invoked as a procedure call.
\end{aside}

=== For Loop
[[forLoop]]
(((action,for loop@`for` loop)))
(((for loop action@`for` loop action)))
(((loop,for@`for`)))
A `for` loop is used to iterate over the elements of a collection. The collection may be of any of the standard `collection' types:  `list`, `cons` and `dictionary`.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{eqnarray*}
[[ForLoop]]ForLoop::=`for`\ <<Condition>>\ `do`\ <<Action>>
\end{eqnarray*}
.For Loop[[forLoopFig]]
\end{figure}
\noindent
For example, the loop:
[listing]
for ("j",X) in list of [ ("j","s"), ("k","t"), ("j","u") ] do
  logMsg(info,X);

results in log messages (see <<logMsg>>) being printed for `"s"` and `"u"` (but not for `"t"` because `("j",X)` does not match against `("k","t")`).

A variant of the `for` loop allows access to the `index' of the element being processed. For example, in the loop:
[listing]
for Ix->P in array of ["alpha", "beta", "gamma"] do
  logMsg(info,"P=$P, index=$Ix");

the variable `Ix` is successively bound to the index of the element being processed.

A `for` loop implies a _scope extension_: variables declared in the pattern have their scope extend to the body of the loop. In this case the variable `X` introduced in the pattern is available for use in the `logMsg` procedure call.

A particularly common case of for loop is the numeric for loop:
[listing]
for Ix in range(0,10,1) do
  logMsg(info,"$Ix")

This will result in the integers 0 through 9 being displayed on the log.

==== Type Safety
A `for` loop is dependent on the `iterable` contract (see <<iterableContract>>; the type safety rules reflect this:
\begin{prooftree}
%\insertBetweenHyps{\hskip 0pt}
\alwaysNoLine
\AxiomC{\typeprd{E}{C}{T\sub{C}\ `where iterable over `T\sub{C}` determines (`T\sub{ix}, T\sub{P}`)`}}
\def\extraVskip{1ex}
\UnaryInfC{{\typeprd{E}{P}{T\sub{P}} {\hskip 2.5in} \typesafe{E$\cup$varsin(P)}{Body}}}
\alwaysSingleLine
\UnaryInfC{\typesafe{E}{`for `P\ `in`\ C\ ` do `Body}}
\end{prooftree}

`for` loops using the indexed form depend on `indexed\_iterable`:
\begin{prooftree}
\alwaysNoLine
\AxiomC{\typeprd{E}{C}{T\sub{C}\ `where indexed\_iterable over `T\sub{C}` determines (`T\sub{ix}, T\sub{P}`)`}}
\def\extraVskip{1ex}
\UnaryInfC{{\typeprd{E}{P}{T\sub{P}} {\hskip 1in} {\typeprd{E}{Ix}{T\sub{Ix}}}{\hskip 1in}\typesafe{E$\cup$varsin(P)}{Body}}}
\alwaysSingleLine
\UnaryInfC{\typesafe{E}{`for `Ix` -> `\ P\ `in`\ C\ ` do `Body}}
\end{prooftree}


=== While Loop
[[whileLoop]]
(((action,while loop@`while` loop)))
(((while loop action@`while` loop action)))
(((loop,while@`while`)))

The `while` loop is used to repetitively evaluate a condition. The loop continues execution for so long as the governing <<Condition>> is satisfiable.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{eqnarray*}
[[WhileLoop]]WhileLoop::=`while`\ <<Condition>>\ `do`\ <<Action>>
\end{eqnarray*}
.While Loop
   [[whileLoopFig]]
\end{figure}

A `while` loop only makes sense if there is a possibility of successive iterations of the body causing a change of state that would make the condition unsatisfiable. A common paradigm for this is the class of _relaxation_ algorithms: algorithms that continue until nothing changes:
[listing][escapechar=|]
var done := false;
while not done do{
  done := true;
  if |...| then
    done := false;
}


Like the `for` loop, a `while` loop also implies a scope extension. Variables defined within the governing condition are available for use within the body of the loop.
\begin{aside}
During each iteration of the `while` loop, only the first `solution' to the governing <<Condition>> is `used' and can therefore result in bindings of variables.
\end{aside}

==== Type Safety
The governing condition must be _satisfied_. Other than that, a `while` loop is type safe if the body is type safe.

\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{\typesat{E}{C}}
\AxiomC{\typesafe{E$\cup$varsin(C)}{Body}}
\BinaryInfC{\typesafe{E}{`while `C` do `Body}}
\end{prooftree}

=== Conditional Action
[[ifThenElse]]
(((action,conditional action)))
(((conditional action)))
(((if then else@`if` `then` `else` action)))

A conditional action is a straightforward `if`...`then`...`else` action: if the governing condition is satisfied the `then` branch is taken; otherwise the `else` branch is taken. The `else` branch is optional in a conditional action; if not present then no action is taken if the condition is not `true`.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{eqnarray*}
[[ConditionalAction]ConditionalAction::=`if`\ <<Condition>>\ `then`\ <<Action>>\ [\ `else`\ <<Action>>\ ]]
\end{eqnarray*}
.Conditional Action[[conditionalActionFig]]
\end{figure}

\begin{aside}
The `test' part of a conditional action takes the form of a _Condition_. This implies that the test may bind variables -- those variables are in scope within the `then' action but are not in scope for the `else' action.
\end{aside}
\begin{aside}
In general, a condition may be satisfied in many different ways. The conditional action only looks for the `first' way of satisfying the condition.
\end{aside}

For example, we can use a <<Search>> condition to verify that an element is in a collection. The fragment:
[listing][escapechar=|]
if {name="j"; amount=X} in Scores then
  |<<Action>>|

tests to see if there is an entry that matches `\{name="j"; amount=X\`} in the `Scores` collection; and, if there is, binds the variable `X` appropriately within `_Action_`.

==== Type Safety
A conditional action is type safe if the condition is safe, and if both the branches are type safe.

\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{\typesat{E}{C}}
\AxiomC{\typesafe{E$\cup$varsin(C)}{Th}}
\AxiomC{\typesafe{E}{El}}
\TrinaryInfC{\typesafe{E}{`if `C` then `Th` else `El}}
\end{prooftree}


=== Switch Actions
[[SwitchAction]]
(((action,switch@`switch`)))
(((switch action@`switch` action)))

A `switch` action uses a selector expression and a set of action rules to determine which action to perform.
\begin{aside}
As with `switch` expressions (see <<caseExpression>>). `switch` actions are often constructed during the process of compiling other kinds of program.
\end{aside}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{eqnarray*}
[[SwitchAction]]SwitchAction::=`switch`\ <<Expression>>\ `in`\ <<SwitchActionBody>>\\
[[SwitchActionBody]]SwitchActionBody::=`\{`<<ActionArm>>\sequence{`;`}<<ActionArm>>`\`}\\
[[ActionArm]]ActionArm::=`case`\ <<Pattern>>\ `do`\ <<Action>>\\
&nbsp;&nbsp;| `case`\ <<Pattern>>\ `default`\ `do`\ <<Action>>
\end{eqnarray*}
.Switch Action
[[SwitchActionFig]]
\end{figure}

The `selector' expression is evaluated, and then, at most one of the <<SwitchAction>>s is selected based on whether the <<Pattern>> matches or not. If one of these does match, then the corresponding <<Action>> on the right hand side is performed.

If none of the <<ActionArm>>'s case patterns match, and if a `default` <<Action>> is specified, then that action is performed. If a `default` is not specified then `nothing` is performed.

Program~\vref{treeWalkProg} shows an example of using a `case` action to walk a tree in left-to-right ordering.
\begin{program}
[listing]
type tree of t is empty or node(tree of t, t, tree of t);

walk has type for all t such that (tree of t, (t)=>())=>()
prc walk(T,P) do {
  switch T in {
    case empty do nothing;
    case node(L,Lb,R) do {
      walk(L,P);
      P(Lb); -- visit the node
      walk(R,P)
    }
  }
};

.A Left-to-Right Tree Walk Program[[treeWalkProg]]
\end{program}


Each <<ActionArm>>'s pattern may introduce variables; these variables are `in scope' only for the corresponding case action.

Optionally, a `case` action may have a `default` clause. If none of the cases in the <<SwitchActionBody>> match then the `default` case is performed. If there is no `default` clause, then if none of the cases match `nothing` is performed -- and execution continues with the next action.


\paragraph{Evaluation Order}
The <<ActionArm>>s in a <<SwitchAction>> are tried in the order that they are written -- with the exception of any `default` <<ActionArm>> -- which is guaranteed to be attempted only if all others do not apply.

==== Type Safety
The type safety requirements of a `case` action are that the types of the patterns of each <<ActionArm>> are the same, and are the same as the selector expression. In addition, the right hand sides of the <<ActionArm>>s should also be consistently typed.

\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{\typeprd{E}{S}{T}}
\AxiomC{\typeprd{E}{P\subi}{T}}
\AxiomC{\typesafe{E$\cup{}$varsIn(P\subi)}{A\subi}}
\TrinaryInfC{\typesafe{E}{`switch`\ S\ `in\{``case`P\sub1\ `do`\ A\sub1\sequence{;}`case`P\subn\ `do`\ A\subn\ `\`}}}
\end{prooftree}

In the case that there is a `default` clause, then that too must be type safe:
\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{\typeprd{E}{S}{T}}
\AxiomC{\typeprd{E}{P\subi}{T}}
\AxiomC{\typesafe{E$\cup{}$varsIn(P\subi)}{A\subi}}
\TrinaryInfC{\typesafe{E}{`switch`\ S\ `in\{`...`; case` P\subn\ `default do` A\subn`;`...`\`}}}
\end{prooftree}

=== Valis Action
[[valisAction]]
(((action,valis@`valis`)))
(((valis action@`valis` action)))
(((returning value to `valof` expression)))

The `valis` action determines the value of the nearest textually enclosing  <<ValueExpression>>.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{eqnarray*}
[[ValisAction]]ValisAction::=`valis`\ <<Expression>>
\end{eqnarray*}
.Valis Action
[[valisActionFig]]
\end{figure}

On executing the `valis` action, the corresponding <<ValueExpression>> `completes' -- no further actions within the <<ValueExpression>> are executed.


\begin{aside}
The `valis` action has special significance within a <<ComputationExpression>>. There the <<ValisAction>> becomes syntactic sugar for an occurrence of the `\_encapsulate` function.
\end{aside}

=== Assert Action
[[assert]]
(((action,assert action)))
(((assert action)))
(((checking code with assertions)))
An _AssertAction_ is an action that simply verifies that a particular condition is satisfied. If the assertion is not satisfiable then execution will terminate.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{eqnarray*}
[[AssertAction]]AssertAction::=`assert`\ <<Condition>>
\end{eqnarray*}
.Assert Action[[assertActionFig]]
\end{figure}

\begin{aside}
It is possible to control whether or not assertions are actually executed -- without modifying the source of the program.
\end{aside}


==== Type Safety
An assert action is type safe if the condition is satisfiable.

\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{\typesat{E}{C}}
\UnaryInfC{\typesafe{E}{`assert`\ C}}
\end{prooftree}

== Exceptions and Recovery
[[exceptions]]
Exceptions represent a way of capturing the non-normal flow of computation. Where a computation may _fail_ this may be denoted by an `exception` being `raise`d during the computation. Raised exceptions may be captured by means of an `on abort` handler.
\begin{aside}
Exceptions and abort handling features are an important tool for expressing non-regular flows of computation. However, excessive use of this feature may result in programs that are hard to read.
\end{aside}

=== The `exception` Type
[[exceptionType]]
(((exception type@`exception` type)))
(((type,exception@`exception`)))
Exceptions and their handling center on the `exception` type. When an exception is `raise`d, there is an opportunity to communicate a value to the handling code; the `exception` is the means by which this is done.

The definition of the `exception` type is given in Program~\vref{exceptionDef}.
\begin{program}
[listing]
type exception is exception(string,any,location)

.The definition of the standard `exception` type[[exceptionDef]]
\end{program}

The first element of the `exception` constructor is intended to be used as a form of code: it is a string that represents the kind of exception. For internally generated errors, the value of this code is the string `"error"`. For user-defined programs, if no value is given to the code then `nonString` is used.

The second element of the `exception` constructor is an arbitrary exception signal. It is of type `any` -- which suggests that it may be any value; however, in most cases, the exception signal is actually a `string`.

The third element of the `exception` constructor is a `location` value. This is typically the source location within the program that gave rise to the exception.

=== Abort Action
[[raiseAction]]
(((raise an exception)))
(((abort computation)))
(((actions,abort with`abort with`)))
The `abort with` action is used to signal that the current computation should terminate abnormally. The form of the `abort with` is given in <<abortWithFig>>.

The type of the `abort expression' depends on the context. In the case of a computation expression (see <<computation>>), the argument must have a type consistent with the error type of the governing monad.

In the case of an `abort with` occurring outside of computation expressions, the type should be `exception`.

For example, in the context:
[listing]
good computation {
  abort with "A message"
}

The type of the expression associated with the `abort with` should be `string`. This is because the implementation signature for the `good` monad is:

[listing]
implementation (computation) over good determines string is ...


=== Abort Handling Action
[[except]]
(((actions,exception handling)))
(((handling exceptions)))
(((try action@`try` action)))
The `try` ...{} `on abort` action allows recovery from actions and expressions that cause exceptions.

\begin{eqnarray*}
[[TryAction]]TryAction::=`try`\ <<Action>>\ `on abort`\ <<SwitchActionBody>>
\end{eqnarray*}
.Try Action
[[tryActionFig]]
\end{figure}

If an exception is caused during the execution of the protected <<Action>> then the handler in entered. This handler takes the form of the body of a <<SwitchAction>> -- i.e., is a sequence of recovery clauses, each of which is a <<ActionArm>>. The pattern part of the recovery clause is matched against the exception value; and the first pattern that matches is used to recover from the exception.

Exceptions are caused either by an error condition -- such as when the equations of a function fail to match a call -- or by an explicit invocation of the `raise` action/expression.

For example, in the fragment:
[listing]
try{
  def A is first(nil); -- Will raise an exception
  logMsg(info,"A is $A");
} on abort {
  case E do logMsg(info,"Had exception: $E");
}

the evaluation of `first(nil)` will fail because `nil` is empty. As a result, the rest of the <<Action>> it is embedded in is aborted and execution continues with the recovery clause.

==== Type Safety
An `try` action is type safe if both arms of the action are safe.
