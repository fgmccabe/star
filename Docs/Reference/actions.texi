@node Actions
@chapter Actions

An action is performed for the sake of its effect. @Star{} has a
normal complement of control flow instructions; although there are
a few departures from some common patterns.

Apart from achieving some effect, actions are associated with a
value. This is the value of the action that is returned when action is
completed.

Actions may also be associated with an exception; in the case that the
action does not complete normally. Unlike many programming languages,
exceptions in @Star{} are strictly statically checked.

The @refer{ValofExpression} is used to denote that a value is to be
computed by performing actions. Similarly, many actions involve the
evaluation of expressions.

@node Actions and Types
@section Actions and Types
@cindex action types
@cindex action!types

Actions have two types associated with them: their @emph{value} type
and their @emph{exception} type.  The action's value type is the type
of any returned value -- i.e., the type of the expression associated
with any @refer{ValisAction}s within the action. The action's
exception type is the type of any exception that may be thrown by the
action.

@node Basic Action Forms
@section Basic Action Forms
@cindex basic action expressions

The basic actions include those in @ref{doFig}. There are additional
actions, as explained in @ref{Fibers}.

@node Nothing
@subsection @code{nothing}
@cindex no operation
@findex nothing
The @code{@{@}} action does nothing; and does not return a value.

@float BNF,nothingFig
@caption{No Operation}
@display
@anchored{NullAction} ::= @code{@{@}}
@end display
@end float

The @code{@{@}} does nothing. Useful when you don't want to do anything.

@node Block Action
@subsection Block Action
@cindex block action

An action block consists of a sequence of actions, enclosed in braces
(@code{@{@}}) and separated by semi-colons.

@float BNF,blockActionFig
@caption{Block Action}
@display
@anchored{BlockAction} ::= @code{@{} @refer{Action} @code{;} @dots{} @code{;} @refer{Action} @code{@}}
@end display
@end float

The empty action block -- @code{@{@}} -- is equivalent to the
@refer{NullAction}.

@node Invoke Action
@subsection Invoke Action
@cindex invoke action

The @refer{InvokeAction} denotes the invokation of a
sub-computation. Typically, an @refer{InvokeAction} takes the form of
a call to a function.
@float BNF,invokeActionFig
@caption{Invoke Action}
@display
@anchored{InvokeAction} ::= @refer{Expression} @refer{TupleLiteral}
@end display
@end float

Any value that is returned by the function call is discarded; however,
if the function throws an exception then that exception is propagated
within the enclosing action.

@node Valis Action
@subsection Valis Action
@cindex valis action
@findex valis

The @refer{ValisAction} denotes that the action should terminate and return a value.

@float BNF,valisActionFig
@caption{Valis Action}
@display
@anchored{ValisAction} ::= @code{valis} @refer{Expression}
@end display
@end float

When a @code{valis} action is performed, its expression is evaluated
and that value is used as the value of the computation.

A @refer{ValisAction} must be lexically enclosed by a
@refer{ValofExpression}. The @refer{ValisAction} terminates that
expression and the value of the @refer{ValofExpression} is the value
computed by the @refer{ValisAction}.

@quotation Note
It is possible that evaluating the expression of a @refer{ValisAction}
may cause an exception to be thrown. In that case, the
@refer{ValisAction} itself aborts and the exception is propagated to
the designated handler.
@end quotation

@node Throw Action
@subsection Throw Action
@cindex throw action
@findex throw

The @refer{ThrowAction} denotes that the action should terminate and throw a value.

@float BNF,throwActionFig
@caption{Throw Action}
@display
@anchored{ThrowAction} ::= @code{throw} @refer{Expression}
@end display
@end float

When a @code{throw} action is performed, its expression is evaluated
and that value is raised as an exception. The syntactically enclosing
action must either be a @refer{TryCatchAction} form, or the action
must be the top-level of a function and that function must have been
declared as throwing a value of the appropriate type.

@quotation Note
If evaluating the expression that denotes the exception to throw
itself throws an exception, that is a fatal error and causes overall
execution of the program to stop.
@end quotation

@quotation Note
There is no automatic search for an handling form: every @code{throw}
must be lexically accounted for.
@end quotation

@node Labeled Action
@subsection Labeled Action
@cindex labeled action

The @refer{LabeledAction} associates a @emph{label} with an
action. Apart from that label, the semantics of the labeled action is
not affected -- unless it lexically contains a @refer{BreakAction}.

@float BNF,labeledActionFig
@caption{Labeled Action}
@display
@anchored{LabeledAction} ::= @refer{Identifier} @code{:} @refer{Action}
@end display
@end float

The scope of the label is limited to the text enclosed within the labeled action.

@node Break Action
@subsection Break Action
@cindex break action
@findex break

The @refer{BreakAction} denotes that the labeled action should
terminate. The action that was labeled is terminated, and computation
proceeds with its natural successor.

@float BNF,breakActionFig
@caption{Break Action}
@display
@anchored{BreakAction} ::= @code{break} @refer{Identifier}
@end display
@end float

When a @code{break} action is performed, it must refer to the label of
a syntactically enclosing action. That action is ended -- with no
further actions taking place within it -- and the labeled action's
natural successor is entered.

@quotation Example
Labeled actions and labeled breaks are a straightforward mechanism for
early exiting loops. For example, in the loop:
@example
firstMultiple(X,M) => valof@{
  L:@{
    for ix in range(1,X,1) do@{
      if ix%M==0 then
        break L
    @};
    valis "not found"
  @};
  valis "found"
@}
@end example
The @code{firstMultiple} function will return @code{"found"} if a
multiple of some @code{M} is found in a range; and @code{"not found"}
otherwise.

This is because, when a multiple is found, we exit the composite
action labeled @code{L}; which proceeds to the next action which
returns the @code{"found"} value.

If the loop ended normally, that is because no multiple was found, and
the action after the loop signals that.
@end quotation

@quotation Note
There is no run-time search for an enclosing label; nor are labels
first class entities. A label is an identifier that is used to
identify (sic) a specific action.

Labels can be nested, however. In the case that there are multiple
occurrences of a label in scope, a @code{break} will always refer to
the lexically innermost labeled action with the same label.
@end quotation

@node Definition Action
@subsection Definition Action
@cindex definition action

The @refer{DefnAction} is used to define variable and to give them a value -- that is
available to subsequent actions. 

@float BNF,defnActionFig
@caption{Definition Action}
@display
@anchored{DefnAction} ::= @refer{Identifier} @code{=} @refer{Expression}
 | @code{(} @refer{Identifier} @code{,} @dots{} @code{,} @refer{Identifier} @code{)} @code{=} @refer{Expression}
@end display
@end float

There are two forms of definition action: defining the value of a
single variable or defining the value of a tuple of
variables. Clearly, in the second case, the right hand side must also
evaluate to a tuple of the same arity.

The scope of any variable declared in a definition actions is from the
declaration itself to the end of the containing @emph{BlockAction}.

@quotation Note
It is an error for a variable to be referenced within its own
definition. Recursive definitions are not permitted within
actions. However, it is possible to introduce functions, including
recursive functions, within an action by using the @refer{LetAction}
form of action.
@end quotation

@node Assignment Action
@subsection Assignment Action
@cindex assignment action
@findex :=

The @refer{AssignmentAction} is an @refer{Action} that replaces the value of a
re-assignable variable with another value. The variable being
re-assigned must have a @code{ref} type -- there is no `implicit'
assignability of a variable or field.

@float BNF,assignactionFig
@caption{Assignment Action}
@display
@anchored{AssignmentAction} ::= @refer{Variable} @code{:=} @refer{Expression}
@end display
@end float

Reassignable variables are typically introduced with a
@refer{DefnAction} of the form:

@example
@var{V} = ref @var{Initial}
@end example

However, if the variable is not otherwise in scope -- i.e., no scope
hiding -- then if the first occurrence of the variable is in an
assignment statement then that is interpreted as the definition of the
re-assignable variable.

@node Conditional Action
@subsection Conditional Action
@cindex conditional action

The @refer{IfThenElseAction} is used to denote a conditional computation.

@float BNF,condActionFig
@caption{If Then Else Action}
@display
@anchored{IfThenElseAction} ::= @code{if} @refer{Condition} @code{then} @refer{Action} @code{else} @refer{Action}
  | @code{if} @refer{Condition} @code{then} @refer{Action}
@end display
@end float

The second form of @refer{IfThenElseAction} -- which omits the
@code{else} branch -- is equivalent to one in which the else branch is
replaced by the @refer{NullAction}:

@example
if @var{Test} then
  @var{A}
else
  @{@}
@end example

@node While Action
@subsection While Action
@cindex while action
@findex while

The @refer{WhileAction} is used to denote an iterative computation that
repeats so long as some condition is satisfied.

@float BNF,whileActionFig
@caption{While Action}
@display
@anchored{WhileAction} ::= @code{while} @refer{Condition} @code{do} @refer{Action}
@end display
@end float

The enclosed action will be repeated zero or more times, for so long
as the test condition is satisfied.

@node For Action
@subsection For Action
@cindex for action
@findex for

@float BNF,forActionFig
@caption{For Action}
@display
@anchored{ForAction} ::= @code{for} @refer{Pattern} @code{in} @refer{Expression} @code{do} @refer{Action}
@end display
@end float

The @code{for} loop iterates over a collection and matches each element
against @emph{Pattern}; which will typically bind one or more variables
that are in scope for the body of the loop.

The type of the collection must implement the @code{generate} contract.

For example, the action:
@example
for (X,Y) in parent do @{
  for (Y,Z) in parent do @{
    gps := [(X,Z),..gps!]
  @}
@}
@end example
collects grandparents into the re-assignable variable @code{gps}. This
action is equivalent to the double @refer{While Action}:
@example
@{
  gps := [];
  G1 = _generate(parent);
  L1: while .true do @{
    G1 resume ._next in @{
      _yld((X,Y)) => @{
        G2 = _generate(parent);
        L2: while .true do @{
          G2 resume ._next in @{
            _yld((Y,Z)) => @{
              gps := [(X,Z),..gps]
            @}
            _yld(_) default => @{@}
            ._end => @{
              break L2
            @}
          @}
        @}
      @}
      _yld(_) default => @{@}
      ._end => @{
        break L1
      @}
    @}
  @}
@}
@end example


@node Let Action
@subsection Let Action
@cindex let action
@findex let

The @refer{LetAction} allows an action to have local definitions
embedded within it. It plays the same role as let expressions do.

@float BNF,letActionFig
@caption{Let Action}
@display
@anchored{LetAction} ::= @code{let} @refer{LetEnvironment} @code{in} @refer{Action}
@end display
@end float

As with let expressions, there are two forms: the non-recursive form
-- using regular braces @code{@{@}} -- and the recursive form -- using
dot-braces (@code{@{..@}}.

@node Case Action
@subsection Case Action
@cindex case action

The @code{case} action selects one of a set of arms depending on the
value of a governing expression. It is the analog of the
@ref{CaseExpression}; oriented to performing actions.

@float BNF,caseActionFig
@caption{Case Action}
@display
@anchored{CaseAction} ::= @code{case} @refer{Expression} @code{in} @refer{CaseActionHandler}

@anchored{CaseActionHandler} ::=@code{@{} @refer{CaseActionRule} @code{.} @dots{} @code{.} @refer{CaseActionRule} @code{@}}

@anchored{CaseActionRule} ::= @ref{Pattern} @code{=>} @ref{Action}
  | @ref{Pattern} @code{default} @code{=>} @ref{Action}
@end display
@end float

As with function definitions, the @code{default} case, if present, is
intended to apply if no other case rules match the governing
expression. As such, it should not be possible for the @code{default}
rule's pattern to fail to apply.

@node Try Catch Action
@subsection Try Catch Action
@cindex try catch action
@findex try
@findex catch

The @refer{TryCatchAction} is used to denote a computation which may
need to respond to exception situations. 

@float BNF,tryCatchActionFig
@caption{Try Catch Action}
@display
@anchored{TryCatchAction} ::= @code{try} @refer{Action} @code{catch} @refer{CaseActionHandler}
@end display
@end float

The type of any exception thrown within the body of the
@code{try}@dots{}@code{catch} must be consistent with the handler. For
example, in:
@example
try@{
  throw 10
@} catch @{
  (E) => @{
    logMsg("We got error $(E)")
  @}
@}
@end example
the type of @code{E} is @code{integer}; which is consistent with the action
@example
throw 10
@end example
action.

@node Valof Expression
@subsection Valof Expressions

@float BNF,valofExpressionFig
@caption{Valof Expression}
@display

@refer{Expression} ::+= @refer{ValofExpression}

@anchored{ValofExpression} ::= @code{valof} @refer{BlockAction}
@end display
@end float

The @refer{ValofExpression} is applied to an @refer{BlockAction}. The
effect of this is to perform the action(s) in the block and return its
value as the value of the @refer{ValofExpression}.

If the actions in @refer{BlockAction} result in the execution of a
@refer{ValisAction} then the expression's value associated with that
action count as the value of the @refer{ValofExpression} itself (and
execution of the actions is terminated).

At least one of the actions executed within the @refer{BlockAction}
must be a @refer{ValisAction}. If @refer{BlockAction} exits with no
@refer{ValisAction} being executed execution of the entire program
halts.
