@section Characters
@cindex character set
@cindex Unicode

@code{Star} source text is based on the Unicode character set. This
means that identifiers and string values may directly use any Unicode
characters. However, all the standard operators and keywords fall in
the ASCII subset of Unicode.

@cindex white space

@menu
* Line Comment::
* Block Comment::
@end menu

@noindent
Input is tokenized according to rules that are similar to most modern
programming languages: contiguous sequences of characters are assumed
to belong to the same token unless the class of character changes --
for example, a punctuation mark separates sequences of letter
characters. In addition, white space and comments serve as token
boundaries; otherwise white space and comments are ignored by the
higher-level semantics of the language.

There are two forms of comment: line comment and block comment.

@node Line Comment
@subsubsection Line Comment
@cindex comment,line
@cindex line comment
A line comment consists of a @code{-- } or a @code{--\t} followed by all
characters up to the next new-line. Here, @code{\t} refers to the
Horizontal Tab.

@float BNF,lineCommentFig
@caption{Line Comment}

@anchor{LineComment}@var{LineComment} ::= (--  | --\t) @var{Char} .. @var{Char}\n
@end smallexample
@end float

@node Block Comment
@subsubsection Block Comment
@cindex comment,block
@cindex block comment
A block comment consists of the characters @code{/*} followed by any
characters and terminated by the characters @code{*/}.

@float BNF,blockCommentFig
@caption{Block Comment}
@smallexample
@anchor{BlockComment}@var{BlockComment} ::= /* @var{char} .. @var{char} */
@end smallexample
@end float

Each form of comment overrides the other: a @code{/*} sequence in a
line comment is _not_ the start of a block comment, and a @code{-- }
sequence in a block comment is similarly not the start of a
line comment but the continuation of the block comment.

@code{Star} supports integer values, floating point values, decimal
values and character codes as numeric values.

@quotation TIP
The lexical syntax for numeric values is for positive values only. The
interpretation of negative numeric literals is part of the grammar,
not the lexical notation.

@node Hexadecimal Integers 
@subsection Hexadecimal Integers
@cindex hexadecimal
@cindex number,hexadecimal
@cindex syntax,hexadecimal

@noindent
A hexadecimal number is an integer written using hexadecimal
notation. A hexadecimal number consists of a leading @code{0x}
followed by a sequence of hex digits. For example,

@smallexample
0x0 0xff
0x34fe
@end smallexample
are all hexadecimals.

@node Floating Point Numbers
@subsection Floating Point Numbers
@cindex floating point

Floating point numbers are written using a notation that is
familiar. For example,

@smallexample
234.45  1.0e45
@end smallexample

See @ref{floatingPointFig} for a complete syntax diagram for floating point numbers.

@end float

@quotation TIP
All floating point number are represented to a precision that is at
least equal to 64-bit double precision. There is no equivalent of
single-precision floating pointer numbers.
@end quotation

@node Character Codes
@subsection Character Codes
@cindex character code
@cindex number,character code
@cindex syntax,character code
@noindent
The character code notation allows a number to be based on the coding
value of a character. Any Unicode character code point can be entered
in this way:
@smallexample
0cX 0c[ 0c\n 0c
@end smallexample

For example, @code{0c\n} is the code point associated with the new
line character, i.e., its value is @code{10}.

@quotation TIP
Unicode has the capability to represent up to one million character code points.
@end quotation

@float BNF,characterCodeFig
@caption{Character Codes}
@smallexample
@anchor{CharacterCode}@var{CharacterCode}::=0c @var{CharRef}
@end smallexample
@end float

A @var{CharacterCode} has type @code{integer}.

@cindex character reference
@cindex syntax,string literal

@menu
* Character Reference::
* Quoted Strings::
* Block String::
@end menu

@noindent
A @code{string} consists of a sequence of characters -- specifically
@var{CharRef}s. There is no specific type in @code{Star} for the
characters themselves -- instead, there are primitives for accessing individual code points as @code{integer}s.

@quotation CAUTION
The reasons for this are due to the fact that Unicode @code{string}
values cannot be easily represented as a unique sequence.
@end quotation

@node Character Reference
@subsection Character Reference
@cindex character reference
@cindex syntax, character reference
@noindent
A @var{CharRef} is a denotation of a single character.

@float BNF,charRefFig
@caption{Character Reference}
@smallexample
@anchor{CharRef}@var{CharRef} ::= @var{Char} | @var{Escape}

@anchor{Escape}@var{Escape}::=\b|\d|\e|\f|\n|\r|\t|\v |
  \ @var{Char} | \u @var{Hex} ... @var{Hex};
@end smallexample
@end float

@noindent
For most characters, the character reference for that character is the
character itself. For example, the string @code{"T"} contains the
character @code{T}. However, certain standard characters are normally
referenced by escape sequences consisting of a backslash character
followed by other characters; for example, the new-line character is
typically written @code{\n}. The standard escapes references are shown
in @pxref{CharEscape}.

@float Table,CharEscape

@end table
@end float

Apart from the standard character references, there is a hex encoding
for directly encoding unicode characters that may not be available on
a given keyboard:
@smallexample
\u34ff;
@end smallexample

This notation accommodates the Unicode's varying width of character
codes -- from 8 bits through to 20 bits.

@node Quoted Strings
@subsection Quoted Strings
@cindex string,quoted

@noindent
A string is a sequence of character references (
@pxref{CharRef}) enclosed in double quotes; alternately a
string may take the form of a @xref{BlockString}.

@float BNF,quotedStringFig
@caption{Quoted String}
@smallexample
@anchor{StringLiteral}@var{StringLiteral} ::= @var{QuotedString} | @var{BlockString}

@anchor{QuotedString} @var{QuotedString} ::= " @var{StrChar} ... @var{StrChar} "

@anchor{Interpolation}@var{Interpolation} ::= [$| \#] @var{Identifier}[:@var{FormattingSpec} ;]
  | [$ | # ] (@var{Expression} )[:@var{FormattingSpec} ;]

@anchor{FormattingSpec}@var{FormattingSpec} ::= @var{CharRef} ... @var{CharRef}
@end smallexample
@end float

@quotation TIP
Strings are @emph{not} permitted to contain the new-line character -- other
than as a character reference.
@end quotation

@smallexample
"This string has a \nnew line in the middle"
@end smallexample

@node Block String
@subsection Block String
@cindex strings,block form of
@cindex block of data


@noindent
In addition to the normal notation for strings, there is a block form
of string that permits raw character data to be processed as a string.

@float BNF,blockStringFig
@caption{Block String Literal}
@smallexample
@anchor{BlockString}@var{BlockString}::=""" @var{Char} ... @var{Char} """
@end smallexample
@end float

@noindent
The block form of string allows any characters in the text and
performs no interpretation of those characters.

Block strings are written using triple quote characters at either
end. Any new-line characters enclosed by the block quotes are
considered to be part of the strings.

The normal interpretation of @code{$} and @code{#} characters as
interpolation markers is suppressed within a block string.

@smallexample
"""This is a block string with $ and
uninterpreted # characters"""
@end smallexample

@quotation TIP
This form of string literal can be a convenient method for including
block text into a program source.
@end quotation

@node Identifiers
@section Identifiers
@cindex identifier

@noindent
Identifiers are used to denote operators, keywords and
variables. There are three main kinds of identifier: regular
alpha-numeric identifiers, graphic identifiers and quoted
identifiers. However, semantically, all these are essentially
equivalent: they all identify some variable or some type.

@menu
* Alphanumeric Identifiers::
* Punctuation Symbols and Graphic Identifiers::
* Quoted Identifiers::
* Standard Keywords::
@end menu

@node Alphanumeric Identifiers
@subsection Alphanumeric Identifiers
@cindex alpha numeric identifier

@noindent
Identifiers in @code{Star} are based on the Unicode definition of
identifier. For the ASCII subset of characters, the definition
corresponds to the common form of identifier -- a letter followed by a
sequence of digits and letters. However, non-ASCII characters are also
permitted in an identifier.

@float BNF,identifierFig
@caption{Identifier Syntax}
@smallexample
@anchor{Identifier}@var{Identifier}::=@var{AlphaNumeric}
  | @var{GraphicIdentifier}
  | @var{QuotedIdentifier}

@anchor{AlphaNumeric}@var{AlphaNumeric}::=@var{LeadChar}@var{BodyChar}...@var{BodyChar}

@anchor{LeadChar}@var{LeadChar}::=@var{LetterNumber}
  | @var{LowerCase}
  | @var{UpperCase}
  | @var{TitleCase}
  | @var{OtherNumber}
  | @var{OtherLetter}
  | @var{ConnectorPunctuation}

@anchor{BodyChar}@var{BodyChar}::=@var{LeadChar}
  | @var{ModifierLetter}
  | @var{Digit}
@end smallexample
@end float

The terms @var{LetterNumber}, @var{ModifierLetter} and so on; referred to in
@ref{identifierFig} refer to standard character categories defined in
Unicode.

@quotation TIP
This definition of @ref{Identifier} closely follows the standard
definition of Identifier as contained in the Unicode specification.
@end quotation

@node Punctuation Symbols and Graphic Identifiers
@subsection Punctuation Symbols and Graphic Identifiers
@cindex punctuation
@noindent
The standard operators often have a graphic form -- such as @code{+},
and @code{=<}. <<standardGraphicsTable>> contains a complete listing
of all the standard graphic-form identifiers.

@float BNF,graphicIdentifierFig
@caption{Graphic Identifiers}
@smallexample
@anchor{GraphicIdentifier}@var{GraphicIdentifier} ::= @var{SymbolicChar}...@var{SymbolicChar}

@anchor{SymbolicChar}@var{SymbolicChar} ::= @var{Char} excepting @var{BodyChar}
@end smallexample
@end float

@quotation TIP
Apart from their graphic form there is no particular semantic
distinction between a graphic form identifier and a alphanumeric form
identifier. In fact, new graphical tokens may be introduced as a
result of declaring an operator -- see <<symbolicOperators>>.
@end quotation

@node Quoted Identifiers
@subsection Quoted Identifiers
@cindex identifier,quoted
@cindex quoted identifiers

@noindent
A quoted identifiers is denoted by a sequence of @var{charRef}s enclosed
in single quotes. Recall that strings are enclosed in double quotes.

@float BNF quotedIdentFig
@caption{Quoted Identifier}
@smallexample
@anchor{QuotedIdentifier}@var{QuotedIdentifier} ::= '@var{StrChar}...@var{StrChar}'
@end smallexample
@end float

A quoted identifier suppresses any operator or keyword interpretation
that the identifier might otherwise have.

@quotation TIP
This can be useful for external facing interfaces where, for example,
the name of a field in a structure must have a particular form -- even
if that would otherwise be a keyword.
@end quotation

@node Standard Keywords
@subsection Standard Keywords
@cindex standard keywords
@cindex keywords

@noindent
There are a number of keywords which are reserved by the language --
these may not be used as identifiers or in any other role.

@quotation TIP
On those occasions where it is important to have an identifier that is
a keyword it is possible to achieve this by enclosing the keyword in
single quotes.

For example, while @code{type} is a keyword in the language; enclosing
the word in parentheses: @code{'type'} has the effect of suppressing
the keyword interpretation -- even though the printed representations are the same.

Enclosing a name in parentheses also has the effect of suppressing any
operator information about the name.
@end quotation
