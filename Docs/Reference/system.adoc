== Time Functions
[[timeFunctions]]
(((time functions)))

=== `nanos` -- Time since start
[listing]
nanos has type ()=>long


The `nanos` function returns the number of nanoseconds since the application started.
\begin{aside}
Note that the returned time may not actually be accurate to the nearest nanosecond. The precise accuracy depends on the accuracy of the clock available to the operating system.
\end{aside}
\begin{aside}
For long running applications, the `nanos` clock may `roll-over' after approximately 290 years.
\end{aside}


=== `sleep` -- Sleep for a period of time

[listing]
sleep has type (long)=>()

The `sleep` action procedure causes the current activity to suspend for a specified number of milliseconds.
\begin{aside}
Other activities, in particular other `actor` activities will continue while this activity is suspended.
\end{aside}

== Logging
An application may log output to standard logging facilities using the `logMsg` action procedure.

=== `level` -- type
(((level type@`level` type)))
[[levelType]]

The `level` type defines a set of logging levels that may be used to indicate the severity of the logged message.
[listing]
type level is finest
  or finer
  or fine
  or config
  or info
  or warning
  or severe;


The different logging levels have an intended interpretation designed to facilitate users of applications manage the type and quantity of logging flow:
\begin{description}
finest:: is used for very fine grained logging, typically insDebugging.
finer:: is used for fine grained logging.
fine:: is used for reporting of internally significant events within an application.
config:: is used to report application configuration events.
info:: is used to report important application events.
warning:: is used to report a recoverable error condition.
severe:: is used to report an unrecoverable error.
\end{description}

=== `logMsg` -- log an event
[[logMsg]]
[listing]
logMsg has type (level,string)=>()


`logMsg` is similar to `logger`, except that the category is fixed to `com.starview.starrules`.

For example, to log an `info` level message one can use
[listing]
logMsg(info,"You need a tune-up")


== Shell Commands
[[shellCommand]]

The `exec` function allows a *Star* program to execute other processes and to access the return code from the sub-process.

=== `exec` -- Execute Sub-Process
[[exec]]
(((exec@`exec`,sub-process)))
(((sub-process execution)))

The `exec` function executes a sub-process and returns the integer return code from running the command.

[listing]
exec has type (string,dictionary of (string,string))=>integer;


The first argument is the command line to execute. The format of this, and the valid commands to execute, is system dependent.

The second argument is a `dictionary` of environment variables and their values. If the dictionary is empty then the environment variables of the current program are inherited by the sub-process.

The return value from executing the command is returned by `exec`. By convention, a return value of zero means that the command succeeded.

\begin{aside}
The `exec`'ed command is executed to completion _before_ the `exec` call returns. If it is desired to execute a sub-process asynchronously then use the `spawn` action:
[listing]
spawn\{ exec("ls -l", dictionary of \{\}) \}

\end{aside}


=== `getenv` -- Get Environment Variable
[[getenv]]
(((environment variable)))
(((getenv@`getenv`,environment variable)))

[listing]
getenv has type (string,string)=>string


Get the value of an environment variable. The first argument is the name of the variable, the second is a default value should the variable not exist.

=== `exit` -- Terminate this Process
[[exit]]
(((exit@`exit` application)))

The `exit` action procedure does not return. Instead, it results in the termination of the process performing the `exit`.


[listing]
exit has type (integer)=>()


The argument of `exit` is used as the value of the process itself. An `exit` value of zero implies that the process terminated successfully.
