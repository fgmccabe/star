This is the reference for the Star language, version {VERSION}.  

This manual offers an in-depth and complete ((description)) of the Star
language. However, it is not a tutorial on the language, and the order
of presentation within the manual reflects that. For a more tutorial
introduction, the reader is referred to _Star Programming_ (by
F.G. McCabe).
