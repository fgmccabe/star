=== Theta Records\
[[thetaRecords]]\
(((record literal,theta)))\
(((theta record)))\
\
A <<ThetaRecord>> is a record whose contents is specified by means of a <<thetaEnvironment>>. There are variants corresponding to labeled and anonymous records.\

\
Externally, a <<ThetaRecord>> is the same as a regular <<Record>>; internally, however, its fields are defined very differently using <<Definition>>s rather than attribute assignments.\
\
If the record is labeled, then, as with all labeled records, the definitions within the <<thetaEnvironment>> must correspond exactly to the type definition.\
\
<<ThetaRecord>>s are especially convenient when the fields of the record are program values. For example, assuming a type definition such as:\
[listing]\
type onewayQ of t is onewayQ\{\
  add has type (t)=>();\
  take has type ()=>t;\
\}\
\
the literal:\
[listing]\
onewayQ\{\
  private var Q := list of [];\
  prc add(X) do \{\
    Q := list of [Q..,X]\
  \}\
  take() is valof\{\
    def H is head(Q);\
    Q := tail(Q);\
    valis H\
  \}\
\}\
\
defines a `onewayQ` record with two exposed program values -- `add` and `take`.\
\

If there are `extra' definitions, they should be marked `private` which will exclude them from the record's type signature.\

A <<ThetaRecord>> has many of the characteristics of an object in OO languages -- except that there is no concept of inheritance; nor is there a direct equivalence of the `self` or `this` keyword.\
