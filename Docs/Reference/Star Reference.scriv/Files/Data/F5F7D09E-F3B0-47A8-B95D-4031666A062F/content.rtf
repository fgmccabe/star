\f0\fs26 \cf0 All type variables have a scope which generally follows the scoping rules for normal variables.\
There are two particular cases that are important: type variables introduced via 
\i TypeDefinition
\i0 s and those introduced via explicitly quantified type expressions.\
A variable introduced in the head of an 
\i AlgebraicType
\i0  definition, or in the head of a 
\i Contract
\i0  definition are in scope throughout the definition or contract respectively.\
