[preface]
== Preface
Star is a functional, multi-paradigm and extensible programming
language. It is a full-scale language, capable of expressing many
kinds of program. As such it is a rich language with many features.
Star was originally developed as part of a framework for processing a
range of real-time business applications such as factory scheduling
and data analytics.  This white paper explores some of the basic
features of the language and shows by example how it can be used to
solve problems.
