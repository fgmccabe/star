\f0\fs26 \cf0 Another benefit that perhaps explains some of the modern excitement is that functional programming represents a more tractable route to developing parallel and multi-threaded programs.\
A program written in a classic von Neumann style is best understood in terms of instructions to a simple machine. Each successive instruction modifies the state of the machine in some way \'96 such as storing values in cells or printing a result.\
The issue with this programming model is that modern machines do not fit the original von Neumann model very well. It is normal now for a single computer to have eight \'91cores\'92, which permit up to 16 independently executing tasks to execute in parallel. Furthermore, modern graphics processors come with thousands of cores \'97 which do not necessarily have to be processing graphics!\
Traditional procedural programming languages have a very difficult time with multi-threaded and parallel programs. Because of the complexity of writing them safely, they must currently be written by \'91programming masters\'92.}
