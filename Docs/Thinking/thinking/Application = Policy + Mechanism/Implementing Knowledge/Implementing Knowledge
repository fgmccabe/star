As a somewhat larger demonstration of the capabilities of Star's macro language, let us look at a significant example: representing knowledge.
There are many knowledge representation languages; here we use one that is based on N3 notation15. In order to be relatively brief, we focus on a very reduced form of this notation: the knowledge triple. A statement of the form:
john ! parent $ sam
is intended to mean
john is parent of sam
more specifically,
john is the subject, parent is the relationship and sam is the object
Such a representation has many uses; one salient one for our purposes is that this kind of notation is very suited to representing configurations of various kinds.
It should also be obvious that such statements are not ordinary expressions or statements. Hence, to integrate such statements into a Star program we have a little work to do!
The first step is to bound the occurrences of such statements — to decide where they are legal. There are several ways of doing this; depending on the kind of extension we want to implement. In this case, we define a new kind of expression — the knowledge graph. N3 statements are legal only in knowledge graph expressions.
For example,
graph{
  john ! parent $ sam
}
is such a knowledge graph expression. We also have to define ! and $ as infix operators — which can be done using:
#right("!",500)
#right("\$",450)
We have to escape the $ because it is a special character in Star string syntax.
The second step is to define how to represent such graphs. We choose to do so by using a data structure:
n3Graph(
  list of [
    triple(concept("john"),concept("parent"),concept("sam"))
  ]
)
So, the task of the macro code is to translate the graph expression into an n3Graph term. The latter is readily understood by the Star compiler.
We are not addressing here how to use such graph expressions.
The core transformation of triples is handled by the macro rule:
# ?S ! ?P $ ? O ==>
  triple(concept(S),concept(P),concept(O))
We use an intermediate concept of concept because the N3 language includes other kinds of concepts — such as strings and numbers.
Notice that the macro rule for triples directly matches the triples that we want to handle. This makes it very clear what the macro is intended to match against.
The concept is also transformed using a macro rule:
#concept(identifier?C) ==> concept($$C)
There are many special purpose operators in the macro language. The $$ operator `converts' an identifier into a string literal. This allows us to reinterpret the john identifier as the string literal "john".
The graph itself it handled in a similar way to individual triples. Since triples are only valid inside a graph, we reflect that with the graph macro too:
#graph{?B} ==> n3Graph(list of [ B ]) ## {
  # ?S ! ?P $ ? O ==>
    triple(concept(S),concept(P),concept(O))
}
The macro replacement form:
Repl ## { Macros }
is the macro analog of a let expression: the macro rules in Macros are in scope for macro processing the expression Repl.
