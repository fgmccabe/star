The origins of Star lie in a platform that was originally oriented towards complex event processing applications.\cite{luckham:2012} StarRules — as it was known then — was a rules language that allowed one to express CEP-style rules succinctly.
However, as often happens, requirements evolved and CEP itself became just one of many application areas that the Starview platform can address. The same pressures for generality in the platform lead to a greater interest in extensibility and generality in the programming language.
