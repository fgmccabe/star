The Star actor represents the simplest possible entity that can respond to speech actions. In that sense, a Star actor is the simplest possible mechanism for embodying responsibility.
There are other entities that also implement the speech contract; in particular, an agent could be seen as being the simplest entity that both responds to speech actions and has some awareness of its own goals and activities.
Thus actors and agents span a range of scales from the very small to the very large, but with a unified representation of `units of collaboration': the speech action. In particular, Star actors are able to operate on a reified representation of query and request speech actions, similar to (but developed independently from) LINQ's approach10.
Star's actors should not be confused with what is arguably the original definition of actor by Hewitt11. Hewitt actors are a representation of concurrent programs; Star actors may or may not be concurrent.
